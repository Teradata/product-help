### Alert Escalation Test

This option tests the full alert detection path for all the nodes/CMICs in a domain or a system, or a specific node or CMIC.

If the test encounters problems, it sends a notification to AIC email subscribers.

During ServiceConnect setup, this test runs automatically for all nodes and CMICs.
