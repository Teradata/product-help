You can connect to more than one database and edit connections as needed. You must have access to port 1025 on the database server.

1.  From the connections menu, select **Edit Connection**.


1.  Select the connection to edit or **New Connection**.


1.  Enter the following:

    -   Connection name: Name you want


    -   Hostname or IP address: Hostname or IP address of the database server


    -   Login mechanism: Software protocol for the connection. TD2 (default), LDAP, BROWSER, KRB5


    -   Authentication: [Optional for TD2 and LDAP] User name and password. If you don't specify, you enter it when you establish the connection.

        If you change your database password after creating a database connection, you must re-connect to the database for the password update to take effect.

        If your password expires, you will be prompted to reset it when you connect to a database.

        **Note:** KRB5 and BROWSER logon mechanisms use external authentication.

Note that not all driver parameters are applicable for all environments and many may require external configuration.
