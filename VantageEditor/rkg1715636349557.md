You can create a query and script without being connected to a system in the object browser. You can select a connection in the script tab, and that connection can be different than the one connected in object browser or in another script tab.

**Note:** Check the query history after running a query or script to see its status.

1.  Use ![""](Images/hhs1689287375241.svg) to add a new script tab.


1.  Select a database connection. To create a new connection, see [Create Database Connection](ylu1715909745412.md).

    If your password expires, you will be prompted to reset it when you connect to a database. If there are no active sessions, your new password will take effect immediately. If you have active sessions, restart Vantage Desktop Editor for the password to take effect. If the password issue persists, contact your administrator to terminate any active sessions.


1.  [Optional] Select a database from the object browser.


1.  Type or paste the SQL statement or script in the script window.

    **Tip:** You can drag any table name over from the **Objects** browser to use in the script. To drag, the object browser and script must be connected to the same system.

    **Note:** To use a variable, enter $\{*variable_name*\}. Set the type and add a hint. When the query is run, you are prompted for the variable.


1.  VantageCloud Lake: If you have been granted access to any compute groups, you can select the one on which to run your query.

    **Default**: Your default compute group is used, if one was specified. Otherwise, the primary cluster will be used.

    **No compute group**: The primary cluster is used.

    **User managed**: No action action is taken to set a compute group for the session. Select this option if you intend to explicitly set the compute group via SQL within the script you are executing. If you define a compute group in your script that is not available (for example, compute group is disabled in the compute profile), the script will return an error. If you don't specify a compute group in your script, the primary cluster will be used.

    *(Individually listed compute groups)*: The selected compute group is used.


1.  **Run** the script.

    **Tip:** To run a single statement in a script, select that statement, then **Run**.


1.  Use ![""](Images/kxu1689287376217.svg) to save the script.


You can sort and filter the results. You can download displayable results in JSON or CSV format, or copy them to the clipboard. If you have more results than can display, use **Save Results to File** to save the entire results set.

**Note:** Change settings for results, for example, number of results to display, quoting, and delimiters using **Settings**:

-   Vantage Editor Desktop: ![""](Images/kxu1689287376217.svg) in the title header


-   Apple Mac: Application > Settings


-   Microsoft Windows and Windows Server: File > Settings


**Note:** Scripts are saved until the script tab is closed. Use ![""](Images/kxu1689287376217.svg) > **Save as** to save the script.
