You can create a query and script without being connected to a system in the object browser. You can select a connection in the script tab, and that connection can be different than the one connected in object browser or in another script tab.

**Note:** Check the query history after running a query or script to see its status.

1.  Use ![""](Images/hhs1689287375241.svg) to add a new script tab.

    **Tip:** You can drag any table name over from the **Objects** browser to use in the script. To drag, the object browser and script must be connected to the same system.

    **Note:** To use a variable, enter $\{*variable_name*\}. Set the type and add a hint. When the query is run, you are prompted for the variable.


1.  VantageCloud Lake: If you have been granted access to any compute groups, you can select the one on which to run your query.

    If you don't select a compute group, your query runs either on your default compute group if you have one, or on the primary cluster.

You can sort and filter the results. You can download displayable results in JSON or CSV format, or copy them to the clipboard. If you have more results than can display, use **Save Results to File** to save the entire results set.

**Note:** Change settings for results, for example, number of results to display, quoting, and delimiters using **Settings**:
