Vantage Editor Desktop is available for VantageCore, VantageCloud Enterprise, and VantageCloud Lake. It allows you to access databases from various sources. All you need is a hostname or IP address and access to port 1025.

You can query and explore databases, view query results, import data into tables, and export results. It includes a query history of submitted SQL statements and their status.

You can do the following:

-   Create, edit, run, and save SQL statements and scripts.


-   Open and upload scripts from other sources.


-   Display up to 5000 rows and save those results to CSV or JSON format. For larger result sets, download the whole result set to a CSV file. There is no limit on the number of rows when you download the results.


-   Copy displayed results to the clipboard.


-   Select **Add to starred** to include a database or user in the list of starred objects.


-   Review status and details of previously run queries.
