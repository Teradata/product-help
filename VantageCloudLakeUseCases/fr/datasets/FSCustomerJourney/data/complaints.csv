In fact, when I looked at more expensive ones, the representative encouraged me to look at something less flashy because it met my needs better. I appreciated that. There have been a couple of small errors in billing but they were quick to correct and credit my account. What a change from my old company where they gave me incorrect information,over-charged me $600, argued with me and said they were just too busy to go over the bill with me. Sometimes I have to wait to get help. But there is someone there who welcomes me, takes my name, offers to get water or coffee and just makes me feel valued. The company has even invested in comfortable chairs for customers who have to wait. I love The Company."""

I travel 100 miles + daily and rely on my phone for emergencies and in the event I have car problems on the road. I will receive a refurbished phone (someone else's problem phone) and no additional extension to the warranty. The CS reps were very nice but are not allowed to go outside Another Company rules regardless of the circumstances. Another Company is and has always been a very uncaring and unconcerned organization when it comes to customer satisfaction.

I kept telling him he had the wrong address but he didn't get it, because when I called back the next day and spoke to an American they still had the wrong address. Finally i was able to clear it up and get started. The first installation guy was supposed to come inside to make sure everything was ready for service I was told to be home for specific hours and had to take off work. I thought the guy never showed so i called and apparently he was just checking the outside of the building and left. When i wasn't able to get a signal with a self install i called them back they sent me a dumb tech who couldn't figure out how to install it either. He said somebody would be coming the next day who could fix it. I asked when and he didn't know just said to wait for a call. Later the next day my neighbor tells me a guy from at&t was on the first floor of the apartment, (I have no buzzers working and specified i must be called to be let in) and i live on the third floor. My neighbor said he waited less than 2 minutes and left without calling me. I swiftly canceled the service and got almost all my money back. During the week i ordered i was suggested to sign up for a hotline u can call to help u self install but if i didn't cancel after a week i would be charged $10. This company is hired by at&t to help customers but even though i never had service i was charged and couldn't get my money back. I had to spend an hour on the phone just to get the company name number and cancel. My last nightmare happened when i returned the modem ups lost it and i was charged $150 it was taken straight out of my account since i was forced to sign a contract with auto something to do with my low credit rating. I called asked what happened they said its lost and they would call me back. They never did two weeks later i found the receipt with the tracking number so i called them back. They got the modem, and said they were sending a request for a full rebate. I get a call today and they sent me a check for $100. I was charged $150.

The real problem with this company is a total lack of after-sales customer srvice: whether it be commercial or technical. It is extremely difficult (almost impossible) to obtain a knowledgeable agent to solve any problem. Generally the personnel are badly trained and badly informed. The real test of a company is not when everything is going well (as it should do!) but how they deal with a problem. The Company scores very, very low.

The voice mail has recently become a problem. I will occasionally get messages a day after they were sent! This has cost me money. I have accumulated over 7000 rollover minutes. However, they are useless if I want to change my plan since I will lose them if I change plans. The customer service has been friendly on the 3-4 occasions that I have needed them. However, my calls to them were informational and not much was accomplished. The phones that I have received have functioned for the duration of the contract.

567,"""I honestly don't understand all the negative comments regarding Another Company. I have had them as a carrier now for several years. I came from The Company who had consistently messed up my bill and over charged me and screwed things up all the time. They only seemed to be about the almighty dollar no matter how they had to get it. Another Company on the other hand has been great!! I have personally found that they will go way above and beyond when it comes to customer service. I had previously owned an HTC Aria. It was a complete lemon of a phone. I went thru the rules and as a result had three different phones sent to me via the warranty. By the time I was ready for phone number four I said there is no way I will take a fourth Aria, obviously it's just a poorly made phone. At which point, I asked to exchange for a Samsung Galaxy and they approved. I was thrilled with that phone and hung on to it until recently upgrading to the Galaxy Note, my new all time favorite phone EVER. Any time I have ever had questions about my bill, phone anything, Another Company has always taken care of my questions or concerns immediately...many times giving me a nice credit on my bill without even asking. Out of all the cell companies I have been with, hands down Another Company has the best customer service. I truly believe they care about their customers and keeping them! They have found ways to lower my monthly bill as well. I have never had a rude or unwilling customer service rep. I highly recommend this company. As far as paying your bill, simply download their app and pay your bill right thru there. Doesn't cost anything. Also, when I have had tough financial months, they are more than willing to work with you, rather than like many companies who just merely shut you down. If you make a payment arrangement with them and stick to it, they will make arrangements with you anytime and never interrupt service. I would never change carriers for nothing! Oh, and as far as quality cell phone service/range....I've never had a dropped call or anything. Very clear, consistant service and phone calls. If ppl are posting all negative about Another Company, I really question their situation...and I promise, I do not work for Another Company, never have and am not paid in any way to post this. Just a very happy customer who have been with them about 9 yrs."""
584,"""I just changed my plan to unlimited minutes, which was very easy to do. However, be aware that they make the change retroactive so that it takes effect from your normal billing date. For me this means that even though my billing cycle is half done they are billing me at the new unlimited rate for the entire billing cycle. In other words, I am paying for two weeks of a service which I never used. This is unfair and I would like to see The Company prorate these charges so that we pay for what we get."""

Well, now at&t wanted to run my credit for the third time within one week. I was approved two times prior. I felt that didn't make any sense. The rep stated that if I allow them to run my credit again, I may receive a better promotion as a new customer. As far as I was concerned I was still a new customer, since I never intercepted the merchandise and it was returned to them unopened. I never received any service.

Called customer service because they had not sent tool to install SIM in new phone but they did not tell me I could use a paper clip. I went by Verison store and had to wait half an hour to get SIM installed. When I called customer to find out how to get pictures off old phone, was told by supervisor to take data card out. When I told her my phone did not have a data card she told me all phones had data card. When I asked her to tell me where it was in the Galaxy Nexus she then told me it did not have a data card I could remove. Went back to store where clerk told me to Bluetooth pictures to new phone but after several minutes of trying told me it would not work but she did not know why. She also told me it was all my fault for buying a phone without a removable data card even though a sales person at the store had directed me to the Nexus last July.

I've wasted countless minutes trying to get help from their ridiculous excuse for a technical support department, as well as the manufacturer. I even took my phone back to the store from which I purchased it and none of them could fix it. First, the touchscreen stopped responding. The music search was a joke. Then it automatically went into silent mode every time it went into sleep mode, and now it will neither send nor receive texts from anyone, except my phone itself. I am disgusted and frustrated with this sham of a company and would never recommend it to anyone. It truly is a waste of time and your hard-earned money."""

I'm just saying you can read all the reviews you want but the best thing to do is to try it for yourself. I personally love The Company and suggest it strongly to my friends. I went traveling to the east coast two years back and went all up and down the coast and had reception ALL the way. As well as it didn't charge me extra roaming fees. Personally I love it.

Our monthly bill was $180, which we soon changed to the share everything plan but they were still charging us $165; every month they would tell us we were going over in our data, but when we would check it ourselves on our phones or by going in to a store we were fine, but yet they would still charge us for it. Our phones didn't even last the year before they started dying out, but they wouldn't let us purchase new ones for anything less than $250. Then we moved to another town and couldn't even get service in our own home. So now that we've cancelled our service 8 months early, they are trying to charge us $450 PER PHONE!!! Our contract clearly states that they can charge us UP TO $350 PER ACCOUNT, definitely not $450 and definitely not per phone. Signing a contract with The Company was nothing but a constant hassle and rip-off. I wouldn't recommend them to anyone."""

Most recently I got on and had the cheeriest, friendliest and genuinely eager person to help me with a billing issue (I was concerned about how much I'd be billed for accepting collect calls) She helped me, and it turned out I was billed nothing extra, But during our conversation when I mentioned I might have to lealve Another Company because I couldn't afford my plan (they do need to work on more affordable plans) she offered me a 40$ credit because of my loyalty thus far.

We have three smart phones with data plans. I do find some surprising gaps in their coverage, frustratingly enough at my office in rural Geauga county. However, that is the exception mostly to a very positive experience. I can understand a lot of the complaints, but my suggestion is, go to one of their service centers and deal with real people first hand. And no, I don't own their stock or work for them."""

So the salesperson cancelled the and placed my order for a Samsung Galaxy Victory. Then I got an email saying the Entro was shipping. I assumed it was another mistake. It wasn't. The Entro arrived. Now that I had the Entro, I called to cancel the Galaxy Victory. Again, the horrible hold music and promos before the order was cancelled. A few days later the Galaxy Victory arrived. I called to find out how to return it. After talking to two agents (horrible hold music and promos twice), I was told I would have to pay to ship it back, then I could call yet again (more horrible hold music and promos) to request a refund on the postage.

Now first they told us just wait until March for one of the phones, June for the other, and the last needed to be in 2 years because it was the newest. Now, we weren't too happy but we dealt with it, come March they said oh no, its 2014, come June, oh no its July, and now we're just fed up and happily. We told them to send it in writing.

This was discovered only after I called and questioned why I was being charged almost double for my calls. And why I had been charged twice for my phone. The one stopped working after seven days (with no damgage done do it) and when I returned the phone for a new one, I was charged again on the bill. Despite the fact that the guy at the store said sometimes phones just stop working. I then recieved a call saying that since I was out of the service area (in MA) that my subscription would be terminated and I would be charged 150 dollars to do so. I called and spoke with someone out of the xx Customer Service Center and was told that I had no options other than to pay the 150 dollars or return my phone (not to be reimbursed and having to pay shipping costs).Â """
194,"""Â I was originally with a big company starting in 1995 and did not switch when The Company took over due to the fact that my contract would be grandfathered in.

538,HATE HATE The Company MADE ME GOT THREW HELL HAD PROBLEMS WITH PIC MESSAGES AND RECIEVEING PIC MESSAGES AND LATER TURING ON MY CELL THEN I GOT MY HUSBANDS CONTACTS TO MY CELL AND HE GOT MINE I WILL NEVER GO BACK TO STUPID The Company EVER!!!!!!!
142,Horrible company to deal with. Defective phone arrived late. They wanted me to pay for returning a defective phone. You call them and wait hours for a live person. They then tell you they have to transfer you to a different department - they then disconnect you. You start all over again. Two hours later you are still nowhere. Ridiculous. I will never use them again. Ever. I would rather not have a cell phone than deal with them. They should be sued in a class action and have to pay millions of dollars. Even that would not be enough punishment for the hell they put me through.
105,I been with The Company since I bought my first android and the service has given me awsom coverage and its cheaper with the best monthly payment oppurtunities compare to other carriers and now I am using my 5th phone IPHONE 5 and The Company is the only carrier that has the cheapest monthly plan I have been really blessed by getting The Company ! love it..
144,I can't believe how unprofessional the staff is. My phone LCD (not the screen) cracked for some unknown reason. I went to get it replaced at the The Company store and they sent me to their repair center to get it replaced assuring me that they would have a replacement. I get to the The Company repair center and they stated that they do not carry the Galaxy S4 32GB and that I would have to call Phone Claim... I call phone claim and I order a replacement 32GB and they send me a 16GB Galaxy S4... I send it back and have to wait 6 days for it to get back to them... I wait the 6 days then call and they state that they received the phone and that the right version will be sent to me and arrive within 2 business days. It's been two business days and no phone... I call PhoneClaim and they stated that the phone has not been shipped... I ask why and they said it was not approved.. The lady on the phone sensed my stress and anger (I guess) and decided to speak to her manager and gets the phone shipped... (supposedly) we will see what happens... Service Sucks!!!
115,I can't say the rest of these reviews are real but I have been a no contract customer for over 5 years now and have not had any problems with the company or phones had sprint but couldn't afford them so I am glad to be out of their contract both myself and my son have the LG optimus elite and aside from normal battery issues will keep The Company mobile calls are not dropped sound is normal as any other phone um I would recommend them for many reasons
167,I have been a customer of this service for over 9 years and sometime in the last 2 years customer service and the quality of service has decreased greatly.
282,I have been using The Company for a little over a month. Love the value. $60/month for unlimited everything compared to my $120 with The Company. Call quality has been okay as I have had only 2 dropped calls in the time I have been with them and so far no major concerns with customer service. I get texts several days before reminding me to top up so I don't have service interruptions.
466,I have had service with The Company for almost two years. It's not the best but it is cheap. I finally upgraded my phone from the lg optimus to samsung galaxy. Really better phone all together. But know I'm trying to put service back on my old phone. And it's not taking. I have called tech support 5 times and received and ridicules excuse why its not working. Each tech has done exactly the same 5 steps the previous tech did. Didn't solve the problem. They document that I have had problems from the begining. Yet they can't solve the problem but they are great at passing the buck to another tech. So know I'm waiting 24-72 hours for a call back for that tech to reset the phone and still have the same problems. These phones are not complicated. There is only so much you can do before they realise it is the phone. I've told them it is the phone. Well know I have to clear my schedule for a phone call. Great!
245,I spent a couple hours on the phone with apple and at&t today about my boyfriend's lost phone. I kept getting comments from both ends about why one provider was better than the other. Apple put me on hold for a LONG time and the advice they gave me was something I had already done. Karen Johnson from The Company was awesome and patient and actually gave me good answers and advice.
213,Overall I am very satisfied with The Company. I had The Company for about 3 years and switched to another company because there was a better phone that I wanted. I stayed there until my contract ran out and switched back to The Company because the coverage and price was so much better. I've been here for about 4 years and don't anticipate switching. I do wish they would get a larger selection of phones.
574,Terrible!!!! I stayed up all night and was second in line to buy the iphone 5s. While I was about to purchase it the sales rep said that because my area code isn't local that he couldn't give me the upgrade discount. Are you freaking kidding me? I just upgraded 6 months ago at the same location. I even called the call center and they said there was nothing they can do. I was just in the store a few days ago too and they didn't tell me that. I don't have one good reason to stay with at&t. As soon as I can get the 5s with The Company then I am terminating my contract with at&t. Please stay far away from at&t!! Horrible customer service.
324,The company's billing is very high and when they charge extra their explanation is confusing and they never send the bill at home the customer service people seen to be answering from a script they dont do much to help their customers I think is because I am under a contract. I think I can find a company at a better cost and the same service some where else most of my friends pay less than I do.
28,The manager in this store is rude like hell.only if he sees a beautiful woman he's a dog right away give all she needs.I really feel that this man in this location is a dick just because I'm an older woman I need to wait and as soon someone younger get into the store he give all the time and she's finish first than me I 'm very disappointing.
35,They care about me as a customer. They treat me with respect and I can tell they want to keep me as a customer. They also have the best network in Chicago.
269,This company is great! I have the National 1000 plan and get national incoming calls any where in us along with national nights and weekends starting @7pm and where in us along with local m2m and only pay $79.99 for 3 phones on this plan. this gives me the freedom to use my phone while on travel and vacation! i also have a blackberry plan on my account. these prices have become cheaper since first coming out which is awesome! i have only had maybe one dropped call since i got there service maybe 2 tops. My internet is fast and i use it all the time while out of town or even shopping to look things up! battery swap is great i can swap my battery if mine is running slow at any us cell store! If i ever have any billing questions i call or stop into store and sales reps are always very friendly and nice helping me resolve any problems that i have. i have never had to have any of our phones sent out for warranty and they always last us at least till our contract is up sometimes even longer!
717,We have been customers for over 5 years and will not switch. We have no reason to. We can't seem to find a better deal or better service anywhere else.
121,i have been with Another Company since they came to baltimore. i love them i pay 60.00 a month for unlimited everything and my warantee i have had a problem only one time with my phone and thats because i dropped it but i went to my local corporate store and for 20.00 i recieved a brand new phone. the oonly thing i dont like is theyy dont have a phone upgrade you pay flat out the price of the phone. if they fix that and give a discount for phone up grades they would get a perfect 10
93,Â I've been with iCompany - Another Company for 4 years now. I have never had a problem - never dropped a call I have free roaming free long distance which is great for my family inutah west virginia etc. I even get roll over minutes. Every time I called customer service they have always helped me and even have a 24/7 late niht number there always on call - this is the best plan / company I have ever had I plan to stay with them. The only thing I dont like is there plans arnt cheap but you get great service
482,"""-Badest customer service -Poor reception -Lots of drop off calls -Bad phones (may be factory refurb sold as new) -Long wait time if you call customer service, many times call disconnect or representative will put on hold for not less 30 min. or (s)he will"""
235,"""After 2 and a half years with one of the big companies, it is such a pleasure to deal with The Company. There was no pressure at all in choosing a phone. In fact, when I looked at more expensive ones, the representative encouraged me to look at something less flashy because it met my needs better. I appreciated that. There have been a couple of small errors in billing but they were quick to correct and credit my account. What a change from my old company where they gave me incorrect information,over-charged me $600, argued with me and said they were just too busy to go over the bill with me. Sometimes I have to wait to get help. But there is someone there who welcomes me, takes my name, offers to get water or coffee and just makes me feel valued. The company has even invested in comfortable chairs for customers who have to wait. I love The Company."""
481,"""BAD SERVICE! poor customer service! Not at all willing to listen and resolve issues. Sarcastic, nasty and should be drummed out of the business! Daughter has called and called and talked to several employees and they are sarcastic and demeaning to her! Not exactly the way a reputable company works. Disgusting."""
89,"""Beware of The Company. It's no more than a bunch of thieves. It took money from my credit card in Nov. When I complained, they told me the money will be applied back to my credit card within 24-48 hours, which did not happen. So far I had to called 25 times and go to the local store 4 times to get my money back. Most of the time they promised me I would receive the money in 24-48 hours. They acknowledged that they wrongfully took my money, but hesitated to return it. What a bunch of crooked thieves!"""
443,"""Buyer beware. You have no recourse with Another Company if you ever have any service problems. I have a new phone past the 30 days (5 months old). I am told I will have to wait a minimum of 5 business days to get a replacement phone during which time I will be totally without service. I travel 100 miles + daily and rely on my phone for emergencies and in the event I have car problems on the road. I will receive a refurbished phone (someone else's problem phone) and no additional extension to the warranty. The CS reps were very nice but are not allowed to go outside Another Company rules regardless of the circumstances. Another Company is and has always been a very uncaring and unconcerned organization when it comes to customer satisfaction. Their overall ratings bare this statement out from other surveys, and they still make no effort to improve or to take care of long term customers that they have never had any problems with. What does this tell you about Another Company? Draw your own conclusion."""

240,"""Coverage sucks. They claim to have coverage on their map in places they do not. The data only works half the time, the other half of the time it will endlessly load but never successfully access a webpage. If you have a new period of service beginning on the 9th and you have an automatic payment method on file, they will start trying to bill you on the 7th. Remember, you have already PAID for service, THROUGH the 8th, but if they have a problem processing your payment on the 7th they will cut your service off and send you an automated text message letting you know. That's stealing as far as I'm concerned. Also, customer service routes you to India, where even the most basic concerns are either misinterpreted due to language barriers or willfully ignored due to policy. Hard to tell."""
582,"""Dear God: PLEASE tell all these carriers that it is better to have 8mbps EVERYWHERE than to have 23 in one place and .5 in another.

Tmo is probably the only one capable of delivering this right away, but they still have Edge in too many places.

684,"""First the Indian guy on the phone has the wrong address and keeps telling me i already have an account with U-verse before i even signed up. I kept telling him he had the wrong address but he didn't get it, because when I called back the next day and spoke to an American they still had the wrong address. Finally i was able to clear it up and get started. The first installation guy was supposed to come inside to make sure everything was ready for service I was told to be home for specific hours and had to take off work. I thought the guy never showed so i called and apparently he was just checking the outside of the building and left. When i wasn't able to get a signal with a self install i called them back they sent me a dumb tech who couldn't figure out how to install it either. He said somebody would be coming the next day who could fix it. I asked when and he didn't know just said to wait for a call. Later the next day my neighbor tells me a guy from at&t was on the first floor of the apartment, (I have no buzzers working and specified i must be called to be let in) and i live on the third floor. My neighbor said he waited less than 2 minutes and left without calling me. I swiftly canceled the service and got almost all my money back. During the week i ordered i was suggested to sign up for a hotline u can call to help u self install but if i didn't cancel after a week i would be charged $10. This company is hired by at&t to help customers but even though i never had service i was charged and couldn't get my money back. I had to spend an hour on the phone just to get the company name number and cancel. My last nightmare happened when i returned the modem ups lost it and i was charged $150 it was taken straight out of my account since i was forced to sign a contract with auto something to do with my low credit rating. I called asked what happened they said its lost and they would call me back. They never did two weeks later i found the receipt with the tracking number so i called them back. They got the modem, and said they were sending a request for a full rebate. I get a call today and they sent me a check for $100. I was charged $150. So i had to send another request for my $50 check they are calling me friday to make sure it goes through. Worst experience of my life called xfinity they were there in two days installed in 1 and a half hours and havent had any problems"""

It was a lot of time I didn't really have, but the lady, Lisa Goss, was absolutely amazing...patient and very, very nice. I was mad...you can't imagine how mad...and she was just great. Their customer service is usually really good anyway though. I think that is why we stick with them even with the other stuff. You just can't find good customer service anymore.Â """

711,"""I have been a The Company customer for a number of years, dating back to the other co days. The real problem with this company is a total lack of after-sales customer service: whether it be commercial or technical. It is extremely difficult (almost impossible) to obtain a knowledgeable agent to solve any problem. Generally the personnel are badly trained and badly informed. The real test of a company is not when everything is going well (as it should do!) but how they deal with a problem. The Company scores very, very low. In summary the service is ok as long as it works, but as soon as you have a problem you can not count on them for help. There are many other better phone companies to choose from!"""
497,"""I have been a customer of The Company for 8 years now. For $100 a month including taxes I have a family plan that includes two lines and 1000 minutes a month.

The voice mail has recently become a problem. I will occasionally get messages a day after they were sent! This has cost me money. I have accumulated over 7000 rollover minutes. However, they are useless if I want to change my plan since I will lose them if I change plans. The customer service has been friendly on the 3-4 occasions that I have needed them. However, my calls to them were informational and not much was accomplished. The phones that I have received have functioned for the duration of the contract. On my last contract I had a Samsung phone where the screen went blank towards the end of the last contract. I waited until the end of the contract to get a new phone. For the money that I am paying, I should be getting internet service included. I am planning to switch to another carrier!"""

On top of the horrible service, my phone would send out the same text up to six times, and sometimes i would send / receive texts the next day!! For your own sanity do not use The Company"""
41,"""I honestly don't understand all the negative comments regarding Another Company. I have had them as a carrier now for several years. I came from The Company who had consistently messed up my bill and over charged me and screwed things up all the time. They only seemed to be about the almighty dollar no matter how they had to get it. Another Company on the other hand has been great!! I have personally found that they will go way above and beyond when it comes to customer service. I had previously owned an HTC Aria. It was a complete lemon of a phone. I went thru the rules and as a result had three different phones sent to me via the warranty. By the time I was ready for phone number four I said there is no way I will take a fourth Aria, obviously it's just a poorly made phone. At which point, I asked to exchange for a Samsung Galaxy and they approved. I was thrilled with that phone and hung on to it until recently upgrading to the Galaxy Note, my new all time favorite phone EVER. Any time I have ever had questions about my bill, phone anything, Another Company has always taken care of my questions or concerns immediately...many times giving me a nice credit on my bill without even asking. Out of all the cell companies I have been with, hands down Another Company has the best customer service. I truly believe they care about their customers and keeping them! They have found ways to lower my monthly bill as well. I have never had a rude or unwilling customer service rep. I highly recommend this company. As far as paying your bill, simply download their app and pay your bill right thru there. Doesn't cost anything. Also, when I have had tough financial months, they are more than willing to work with you, rather than like many companies who just merely shut you down. If you make a payment arrangement with them and stick to it, they will make arrangements with you anytime and never interrupt service. I would never change carriers for nothing! Oh, and as far as quality cell phone service/range....I've never had a dropped call or anything. Very clear, consistant service and phone calls. If ppl are posting all negative about Another Company, I really question their situation...and I promise, I do not work for Another Company, never have and am not paid in any way to post this. Just a very happy customer who have been with them about 9 yrs."""
458,"""I just changed my plan to unlimited minutes, which was very easy to do. However, be aware that they make the change retroactive so that it takes effect from your normal billing date. For me this means that even though my billing cycle is half done they are billing me at the new unlimited rate for the entire billing cycle. In other words, I am paying for two weeks of a service which I never used. This is unfair and I would like to see The Company prorate these charges so that we pay for what we get."""
307,"""I ordered new service and was given different promotional information by three different representatives. When I realized that the plan I recently ordered five days prior did not offer me the complete promotional details for my area, I cancelled it. I then placed another order with the better promotion. That same day I received an email stating the order I had just placed was cancelled due to dual orders placed. I called to conflict issue and place yet another order. Well, now at&t wanted to run my credit for the third time within one week. I was approved two times prior. I felt that didn't make any sense. The rep stated that if I allow them to run my credit again, I may receive a better promotion as a new customer. As far as I was concerned I was still a new customer, since I never intercepted the merchandise and it was returned to them unopened. I never received any service. That was a true indicator of the customer service I would receive if I were to continue to proceed to receive the service....

Until recently. It seems they are now spending a lot of money advertising about their happy customers and apparently a lot less money on actual customer service. Today when I had an issue, I was transferred several times, treated with alternating rudeness or apathy and no one cared to fix my issue. And, in fact, they never did fix it. Even when I asked to speak to a customer service supervisor. Bottom line? The only thing they really had going for them was their great customer service.

Our phones didn't even last the year before they started dying out, but they wouldn't let us purchase new ones for anything less than $250.

We go to a local The Company store when we have questions or to buy new phones [Stow-Kent Plaza, Stow, OH] and have always found the employees friendly and helpful in numerous ways, including suggestions to reduce costs. We have three smart phones with data plans. I do find some surprising gaps in their coverage, frustratingly enough at my office in rural Geauga county. However, that is the exception mostly to a very positive experience. I can understand a lot of the complaints, but my suggestion is, go to one of their service centers and deal with real people first hand. And no, I don't own their stock or work for them."""

After listening to horrible hold music and promos) I was told the phone was on backorder and wouldn't be available for at least 6 months. So the salesperson cancelled the and placed my order for a Samsung Galaxy Victory. Then I got an email saying the Entro was shipping. I assumed it was another mistake. It wasn't. The Entro arrived. Now that I had the Entro, I called to cancel the Galaxy Victory. Again, the horrible hold music and promos before the order was cancelled. A few days later the Galaxy Victory arrived. I called to find out how to return it. After talking to two agents (horrible hold music and promos twice), I was told I would have to pay to ship it back, then I could call yet again (more horrible hold music and promos) to request a refund on the postage. I couldn't take anymore. I was quite rude to the agent and hung up on her. The service is good (and cheap) but don't buy your phones from The Company!"""

Now first they told us just wait until March for one of the phones, June for the other, and the last needed to be in 2 years because it was the newest. Now, we weren't too happy but we dealt with it, come March they said oh no, its 2014, come June, oh no its July, and now we're just fed up and happily. We told them to send it in writing. Come July, my family was spitting fire because they were trying to get us to stay and trying to feed us a bunch of B.S. I recommend to stay away from The Company"""

However, after the 30 trial period was up, I was given a call telling me that I was not in a proper service area (though I had a nation wide plan). This was discovered only after I called and questioned why I was being charged almost double for my calls. And why I had been charged twice for my phone. The one stopped working after seven days (with no damgage done do it) and when I returned the phone for a new one, I was charged again on the bill. Despite the fact that the guy at the store said sometimes phones just stop working. I then recieved a call saying that since I was out of the service area (in MA) that my subscription would be terminated and I would be charged 150 dollars to do so. I called and spoke with someone out of the xx Customer Service Center and was told that I had no options other than to pay the 150 dollars or return my phone (not to be reimbursed and having to pay shipping costs).Â """
326,"""Â I was originally with a big company starting in 1995 and did not switch when The Company took over due to the fact that my contract would be grandfathered in.

I do not see a need for those """"smart"""" phones since I have a nav system and a 10 disc sirus system in my vehicles, a PS3 at home, laptop and desktop computers at home and work just like everyone else. if you have to have a smart phone you are either a teenager or you are in dire need of a secretary."""
541,Go to all companies and see how different each one treats you. If they are pleasent its worth it. The Company is so much better and their customer service is a ten.
303,HATE HATE The Company MADE ME GOT THREW HELL HAD PROBLEMS WITH PIC MESSAGES AND RECIEVEING PIC MESSAGES AND LATER TURING ON MY CELL THEN I GOT MY HUSBANDS CONTACTS TO MY CELL AND HE GOT MINE I WILL NEVER GO BACK TO STUPID The Company EVER!!!!!!!
200,Horrible company to deal with. Defective phone arrived late. They wanted me to pay for returning a defective phone. You call them and wait hours for a live person. They then tell you they have to transfer you to a different department - they then disconnect you. You start all over again. Two hours later you are still nowhere. Ridiculous. I will never use them again. Ever. I would rather not have a cell phone than deal with them. They should be sued in a class action and have to pay millions of dollars. Even that would not be enough punishment for the hell they put me through.
577,I been with The Company since I bought my first android and the service has given me awsom coverage and its cheaper with the best monthly payment oppurtunities compare to other carriers and now I am using my 5th phone IPHONE 5 and The Company is the only carrier that has the cheapest monthly plan I have been really blessed by getting The Company ! love it..
234,I can't believe how unprofessional the staff is. My phone LCD (not the screen) cracked for some unknown reason. I went to get it replaced at the The Company store and they sent me to their repair center to get it replaced assuring me that they would have a replacement. I get to the The Company repair center and they stated that they do not carry the Galaxy S4 32GB and that I would have to call Phone Claim... I call phone claim and I order a replacement 32GB and they send me a 16GB Galaxy S4... I send it back and have to wait 6 days for it to get back to them... I wait the 6 days then call and they state that they received the phone and that the right version will be sent to me and arrive within 2 business days. It's been two business days and no phone... I call PhoneClaim and they stated that the phone has not been shipped... I ask why and they said it was not approved.. The lady on the phone sensed my stress and anger (I guess) and decided to speak to her manager and gets the phone shipped... (supposedly) we will see what happens... Service Sucks!!!
87,I can't say the rest of these reviews are real but I have been a no contract customer for over 5 years now and have not had any problems with the company or phones had sprint but couldn't afford them so I am glad to be out of their contract both myself and my son have the LG optimus elite and aside from normal battery issues will keep The Company mobile calls are not dropped sound is normal as any other phone um I would recommend them for many reasons
317,I have been a customer of this service for over 9 years and sometime in the last 2 years customer service and the quality of service has decreased greatly.
396,I have been using The Company for a little over a month. Love the value. $60/month for unlimited everything compared to my $120 with The Company. Call quality has been okay as I have had only 2 dropped calls in the time I have been with them and so far no major concerns with customer service. I get texts several days before reminding me to top up so I don't have service interruptions.

636,I have had service with The Company for almost two years. It's not the best but it is cheap. I finally upgraded my phone from the lg optimus to samsung galaxy. Really better phone all together. But know I'm trying to put service back on my old phone. And it's not taking. I have called tech support 5 times and received and ridicules excuse why its not working. Each tech has done exactly the same 5 steps the previous tech did. Didn't solve the problem. They document that I have had problems from the begining. Yet they can't solve the problem but they are great at passing the buck to another tech. So know I'm waiting 24-72 hours for a call back for that tech to reset the phone and still have the same problems. These phones are not complicated. There is only so much you can do before they realise it is the phone. I've told them it is the phone. Well know I have to clear my schedule for a phone call. Great!
796,I spent a couple hours on the phone with apple and at&t today about my boyfriend's lost phone. I kept getting comments from both ends about why one provider was better than the other. Apple put me on hold for a LONG time and the advice they gave me was something I had already done. Karen Johnson from The Company was awesome and patient and actually gave me good answers and advice.
277,Overall I am very satisfied with The Company. I had The Company for about 3 years and switched to another company because there was a better phone that I wanted. I stayed there until my contract ran out and switched back to The Company because the coverage and price was so much better. I've been here for about 4 years and don't anticipate switching. I do wish they would get a larger selection of phones.
710,Terrible!!!! I stayed up all night and was second in line to buy the iphone 5s. While I was about to purchase it the sales rep said that because my area code isn't local that he couldn't give me the upgrade discount. Are you freaking kidding me? I just upgraded 6 months ago at the same location. I even called the call center and they said there was nothing they can do. I was just in the store a few days ago too and they didn't tell me that. I don't have one good reason to stay with at&t. As soon as I can get the 5s with The Company then I am terminating my contract with at&t. Please stay far away from at&t!! Horrible customer service.
231,The company's billing is very high and when they charge extra their explanation is confusing and they never send the bill at home the customer service people seen to be answering from a script they dont do much to help their customers I think is because I am under a contract. I think I can find a company at a better cost and the same service some where else most of my friends pay less than I do.
330,The manager in this store is rude like hell.only if he sees a beautiful woman he's a dog right away give all she needs.I really feel that this man in this location is a dick just because I'm an older woman I need to wait and as soon someone younger get into the store he give all the time and she's finish first than me I 'm very disappointing.
216,They care about me as a customer. They treat me with respect and I can tell they want to keep me as a customer. They also have the best network in Chicago.
221,This company is great! I have the National 1000 plan and get national incoming calls any where in us along with national nights and weekends starting @7pm and where in us along with local m2m and only pay $79.99 for 3 phones on this plan. this gives me the freedom to use my phone while on travel and vacation! i also have a blackberry plan on my account. these prices have become cheaper since first coming out which is awesome! i have only had maybe one dropped call since i got there service maybe 2 tops. My internet is fast and i use it all the time while out of town or even shopping to look things up! battery swap is great i can swap my battery if mine is running slow at any us cell store! If i ever have any billing questions i call or stop into store and sales reps are always very friendly and nice helping me resolve any problems that i have. i have never had to have any of our phones sent out for warranty and they always last us at least till our contract is up sometimes even longer!
480,We have been customers for over 5 years and will not switch. We have no reason to. We can't seem to find a better deal or better service anywhere else.
659,i have been with Another Company since they came to baltimore. i love them i pay 60.00 a month for unlimited everything and my warantee i have had a problem only one time with my phone and thats because i dropped it but i went to my local corporate store and for 20.00 i recieved a brand new phone. the oonly thing i dont like is theyy dont have a phone upgrade you pay flat out the price of the phone. if they fix that and give a discount for phone up grades they would get a perfect 10
798,Â I've been with iCompany - Another Company for 4 years now. I have never had a problem - never dropped a call I have free roaming free long distance which is great for my family inutah west virginia etc. I even get roll over minutes. Every time I called customer service they have always helped me and even have a 24/7 late niht number there always on call - this is the best plan / company I have ever had I plan to stay with them. The only thing I dont like is there plans arnt cheap but you get great service

712,"""After 2 and a half years with one of the big companies, it is such a pleasure to deal with The Company. There was no pressure at all in choosing a phone. In fact, when I looked at more expensive ones, the representative encouraged me to look at something less flashy because it met my needs better. I appreciated that. There have been a couple of small errors in billing but they were quick to correct and credit my account. What a change from my old company where they gave me incorrect information,over-charged me $600, argued with me and said they were just too busy to go over the bill with me. Sometimes I have to wait to get help. But there is someone there who welcomes me, takes my name, offers to get water or coffee and just makes me feel valued. The company has even invested in comfortable chairs for customers who have to wait. I love The Company."""
479,"""BAD SERVICE! poor customer service! Not at all willing to listen and resolve issues. Sarcastic, nasty and should be drummed out of the business! Daughter has called and called and talked to several employees and they are sarcastic and demeaning to her! Not exactly the way a reputable company works. Disgusting."""
680,"""Beware of The Company. It's no more than a bunch of thieves. It took money from my credit card in Nov. When I complained, they told me the money will be applied back to my credit card within 24-48 hours, which did not happen. So far I had to called 25 times and go to the local store 4 times to get my money back. Most of the time they promised me I would receive the money in 24-48 hours. They acknowledged that they wrongfully took my money, but hesitated to return it. What a bunch of crooked thieves!"""
376,"""Buyer beware. You have no recourse with Another Company if you ever have any service problems. I have a new phone past the 30 days (5 months old). I am told I will have to wait a minimum of 5 business days to get a replacement phone during which time I will be totally without service. I travel 100 miles + daily and rely on my phone for emergencies and in the event I have car problems on the road. I will receive a refurbished phone (someone else's problem phone) and no additional extension to the warranty. The CS reps were very nice but are not allowed to go outside Another Company rules regardless of the circumstances. Another Company is and has always been a very uncaring and unconcerned organization when it comes to customer satisfaction. Their overall ratings bare this statement out from other surveys, and they still make no effort to improve or to take care of long term customers that they have never had any problems with. What does this tell you about Another Company? Draw your own conclusion."""

117,"""Coverage sucks. They claim to have coverage on their map in places they do not. The data only works half the time, the other half of the time it will endlessly load but never successfully access a webpage. If you have a new period of service beginning on the 9th and you have an automatic payment method on file, they will start trying to bill you on the 7th. Remember, you have already PAID for service, THROUGH the 8th, but if they have a problem processing your payment on the 7th they will cut your service off and send you an automated text message letting you know. That's stealing as far as I'm concerned. Also, customer service routes you to India, where even the most basic concerns are either misinterpreted due to language barriers or willfully ignored due to policy. Hard to tell."""

285,"""First the Indian guy on the phone has the wrong address and keeps telling me i already have an account with U-verse before i even signed up. I kept telling him he had the wrong address but he didn't get it, because when I called back the next day and spoke to an American they still had the wrong address. Finally i was able to clear it up and get started. The first installation guy was supposed to come inside to make sure everything was ready for service I was told to be home for specific hours and had to take off work. I thought the guy never showed so i called and apparently he was just checking the outside of the building and left. When i wasn't able to get a signal with a self install i called them back they sent me a dumb tech who couldn't figure out how to install it either. He said somebody would be coming the next day who could fix it. I asked when and he didn't know just said to wait for a call. Later the next day my neighbor tells me a guy from at&t was on the first floor of the apartment, (I have no buzzers working and specified i must be called to be let in) and i live on the third floor. My neighbor said he waited less than 2 minutes and left without calling me. I swiftly canceled the service and got almost all my money back. During the week i ordered i was suggested to sign up for a hotline u can call to help u self install but if i didn't cancel after a week i would be charged $10. This company is hired by at&t to help customers but even though i never had service i was charged and couldn't get my money back. I had to spend an hour on the phone just to get the company name number and cancel. My last nightmare happened when i returned the modem ups lost it and i was charged $150 it was taken straight out of my account since i was forced to sign a contract with auto something to do with my low credit rating. I called asked what happened they said its lost and they would call me back. They never did two weeks later i found the receipt with the tracking number so i called them back. They got the modem, and said they were sending a request for a full rebate. I get a call today and they sent me a check for $100. I was charged $150.

It was a lot of time I didn't really have, but the lady, Lisa Goss, was absolutely amazing...patient and very, very nice. I was mad...you can't imagine how mad...and she was just great.

268,"""I have been a The Company customer for a number of years, dating back to the other co days. The real problem with this company is a total lack of after-sales customer service: whether it be commercial or technical. It is extremely difficult (almost impossible) to obtain a knowledgeable agent to solve any problem. Generally the personnel are badly trained and badly informed. The real test of a company is not when everything is going well (as it should do!) but how they deal with a problem. The Company scores very, very low. In summary the service is ok as long as it works, but as soon as you have a problem you can not count on them for help. There are many other better phone companies to choose from!"""
521,"""I have been a customer of The Company for 8 years now. For $100 a month including taxes I have a family plan that includes two lines and 1000 minutes a month. I do not text or use the internet. The service has been o.k. for the most part. I get reception almost everywhere in NYC but I sometimes lose calls in parts of stores. The voice mail has recently become a problem. I will occasionally get messages a day after they were sent! This has cost me money. I have accumulated over 7000 rollover minutes. However, they are useless if I want to change my plan since I will lose them if I change plans. The customer service has been friendly on the 3-4 occasions that I have needed them. However, my calls to them were informational and not much was accomplished. The phones that I have received have functioned for the duration of the contract. On my last contract I had a Samsung phone where the screen went blank towards the end of the last contract. I waited until the end of the contract to get a new phone. For the money that I am paying, I should be getting internet service included. I am planning to switch to another carrier!"""
395,"""I have been with Another Company since 2008; never had a call dropped or issues with my handset. I started with the basic BASIC phone and now have the PinkBerry..other than my phone dying completely after a year and a 1/2 the phone itself is fine. I frequent the corporate office for any questions and needs, and the always have the best customer service. In the past year, I have added 3 other lines to my service and no one has a problem (other than they use the internet too much)"""
39,"""I have great service as far as phone,internet and overall customer service. However when it comes to the subject in my header they lack in product .I have the new S4 and wile by the looks and feel of the phone is very nice,its comes with restrictions that most everyday people wouldn't know.A LOCKED DOWN BOOTLOADER!!!!! thwe buy a $600 phone and we should not be held back from what its full potential really is.if b u want a completely unlocked S4 than I would look to buy a Tmobile S4."""
707,"""I have had The Company forEVER and feel very comfortable. Friends & Family was my main draw for a long time. Now that I am starting to count pennies a little more I realize that I have been paying for cream of the crop phone service for a long time. Time for me to bring it down a few notches and use the extra cash to pay off some debt. The Company costs a little more but IMO, if you can can afford why go elsewhere?"""
389,"""I have had The Company since October, 2002 and was off at college in the boonies. I've been on the same plan since then and get 1000 anytime minutes with free incoming calls/messages for $40/mo. The customer service is excellent and they're very flexible with me about upgrading my phone before my contract is up."""
122,"""I have tried out company x, another company, The Company, and The Company and i can absolutely say The Company is the worst carrier I have ever had. The service is nothing short of terrible, I live in the city and barely get one bar at times, and when i do miraculously have full bars it is still slower than molasses. On top of the horrible service, my phone would send out the same text up to six times, and sometimes i would send / receive texts the next day!! For your own sanity do not use The Company"""
630,"""I honestly don't understand all the negative comments regarding Another Company. I have had them as a carrier now for several years. I came from The Company who had consistently messed up my bill and over charged me and screwed things up all the time. They only seemed to be about the almighty dollar no matter how they had to get it. Another Company on the other hand has been great!! I have personally found that they will go way above and beyond when it comes to customer service. I had previously owned an HTC Aria. It was a complete lemon of a phone. I went thru the rules and as a result had three different phones sent to me via the warranty. By the time I was ready for phone number four I said there is no way I will take a fourth Aria, obviously it's just a poorly made phone. At which point, I asked to exchange for a Samsung Galaxy and they approved. I was thrilled with that phone and hung on to it until recently upgrading to the Galaxy Note, my new all time favorite phone EVER. Any time I have ever had questions about my bill, phone anything, Another Company has always taken care of my questions or concerns immediately...many times giving me a nice credit on my bill without even asking. Out of all the cell companies I have been with, hands down Another Company has the best customer service. I truly believe they care about their customers and keeping them! They have found ways to lower my monthly bill as well. I have never had a rude or unwilling customer service rep. I highly recommend this company. As far as paying your bill, simply download their app and pay your bill right thru there. Doesn't cost anything. Also, when I have had tough financial months, they are more than willing to work with you, rather than like many companies who just merely shut you down. If you make a payment arrangement with them and stick to it, they will make arrangements with you anytime and never interrupt service. I would never change carriers for nothing! Oh, and as far as quality cell phone service/range....I've never had a dropped call or anything. Very clear, consistant service and phone calls. If ppl are posting all negative about Another Company, I really question their situation...and I promise, I do not work for Another Company, never have and am not paid in any way to post this. Just a very happy customer who have been with them about 9 yrs."""
589,"""I just changed my plan to unlimited minutes, which was very easy to do. However, be aware that they make the change retroactive so that it takes effect from your normal billing date. For me this means that even though my billing cycle is half done they are billing me at the new unlimited rate for the entire billing cycle. In other words, I am paying for two weeks of a service which I never used. This is unfair and I would like to see The Company prorate these charges so that we pay for what we get."""
332,"""I ordered new service and was given different promotional information by three different representatives. When I realized that the plan I recently ordered five days prior did not offer me the complete promotional details for my area, I cancelled it. I then placed another order with the better promotion. That same day I received an email stating the order I had just placed was cancelled due to dual orders placed. I called to conflict issue and place yet another order. Well, now at&t wanted to run my credit for the third time within one week. I was approved two times prior. I felt that didn't make any sense. The rep stated that if I allow them to run my credit again, I may receive a better promotion as a new customer. As far as I was concerned I was still a new customer, since I never intercepted the merchandise and it was returned to them unopened. I never received any service. That was a true indicator of the customer service I would receive if I were to continue to proceed to receive the service.... The Company sucked ten years ago when they took ameritech and they STILL SUCK. NOT ABOUT THE CUSTOMER."""
738,"""Â After my plan ran up, I renewed my plan, but before doing so I told them that I would be moving to live in MA permanetly. I asked if I would get service and was told I would. However, after the 30 trial period was up, I was given a call telling me that I was not in a proper service area (though I had a nation wide plan). This was discovered only after I called and questioned why I was being charged almost double for my calls. And why I had been charged twice for my phone. The one stopped working after seven days (with no damgage done do it) and when I returned the phone for a new one, I was charged again on the bill. Despite the fact that the guy at the store said sometimes phones just stop working. I then recieved a call saying that since I was out of the service area (in MA) that my subscription would be terminated and I would be charged 150 dollars to do so. I called and spoke with someone out of the xx Customer Service Center and was told that I had no options other than to pay the 150 dollars or return my phone (not to be reimbursed and having to pay shipping costs).Â """
624,"""Â I was originally with a big company starting in 1995 and did not switch when The Company took over due to the fact that my contract would be grandfathered in. I have been more than happy with their service and prices. I have no incoming charges, nights for me stayed the same from Primeco free after 7pm, 1000 prime min. free. Free incoming texts. I do not see a need for those """"smart"""" phones since I have a nav system and a 10 disc sirus system in my vehicles, a PS3 at home, laptop and desktop computers at home and work just like everyone else. if you have to have a smart phone you are either a teenager or you are in dire need of a secretary."""
637,Go to all companies and see how different each one treats you. If they are pleasent its worth it. The Company is so much better and their customer service is a ten.

I also had to file a dispute form through my bank last month because the company had overcharged me $50 and magically could not find any record of it. That issue still has not been resolved. I could let fifty bucks slide but now it is a matter of principle. I'm pissed. Is the savings worth this crap?"" ""I bought the new HTC EVO 5 because it seemed like a good deal and the service price was a little cheaper than my T Mobile plan-big mistake,my internet and text messaging did not work after 3 days.

I tried this 5 times and got nowhere while chatting with an agent who would also not give me any help. Finally, I DEMANDED a supervisor after the agent, Darwin, would not give me an email address for Customer Care. I spent a total of two hours on the phone and an 8 hour day connecting to The Company. It finally works, but if this is how it begins, I prefer not to continue with them. Since I received calls from them, I asked that they not add that time to my 300 minutes limit, but the responded by telling me I should have called *86. They just don't get it.

If you can give a REAL bad example of customer service, and not blame them because you dont pay attention to your bill, your contract that you sign or because they just wont give you credits for all of your overage charges, because you were not responsible enough to watch your minutes.

The only exception was once when traveling to South Carolina (the service was a little spotty in some places back there). I just purchased the Samsung Galaxy S3 and I love it! I've had the phone for about 3 months now and have had ZERO ISSUES with the phone or the service! I pay $50.00 a month ($45 for the service and $5 for the phone insurance) and am very happy with my service that I receive.

As a regional carrier, their coverage has never been the greatest and their phone offerings are behind the curve and sometimes really disappointing in quality, but their superior customer service was what kept me as a loyal customer. Until recently. It seems they are now spending a lot of money advertising about their happy customers and apparently a lot less money on actual customer service. Today when I had an issue, I was transferred several times, treated with alternating rudeness or apathy and no one cared to fix my issue. And, in fact, they never did fix it. Even when I asked to speak to a customer service supervisor. Bottom line? The only thing they really had going for them was their great customer service. Since they don't have that anymore, there is no reason to consider them. Not to say some local places may not still have good customer service - but as a caution, their phone support center is now right up there with the worst of the worst."""

When I told her my phone did not have a data card she told me all phones had data card. When I asked her to tell me where it was in the Galaxy Nexus she then told me it did not have a data card I could remove. Went back to store where clerk told me to Bluetooth pictures to new phone but after several minutes of trying told me it would not work but she did not know why.

Then it automatically went into silent mode every time it went into sleep mode, and now it will neither send nor receive texts from anyone, except my phone itself.

Our phones didn't even last the year before they started dying out, but they wouldn't let us purchase new ones for anything less than $250. Then we moved to another town and couldn't even get service in our own home. So now that we've cancelled our service 8 months early, they are trying to charge us $450 PER PHONE!!!

Prices are a little higher than some of the other companies but I feel they are worth it due to the reliable coverage I get."""
555,"""We have been with The Company for 8 + years, after leaving an The Company. We go to a local The Company store when we have questions or to buy new phones [Stow-Kent Plaza, Stow, OH] and have always found the employees friendly and helpful in numerous ways, including suggestions to reduce costs. We have three smart phones with data plans. I do find some surprising gaps in their coverage, frustratingly enough at my office in rural Geauga county. However, that is the exception mostly to a very positive experience. I can understand a lot of the complaints, but my suggestion is, go to one of their service centers and deal with real people first hand. And no, I don't own their stock or work for them."""
259,"""We've had The Company for several years and added our kids phones on the family plan just last year. Free nights (after 7 p.m.) and weekends are great. Plus, they just turned on a new tower about six blocks from our home and service on calls is incredible."""
663,"""We've had The Company for years in southeastern NC. Our experience is 100% positive. The only bad thing I could say is sometimes the place is so crowded we have to wait, but they keep training more agents, who are friendly and helpful. They suggest ways we could save money--ask about their """"Partners"""" program. If your employer uses USC you can get a discount on your personal account. The repair department has helped me out several times."""
594,"""Well if you enjoy not getting the call's you need or getting text messages three days later, this is the plan for you! If you really love paying more for less this is exactly what you'll get. And best of all if you get your jollies by spending all day on hold waiting to talk to a grouchy customer service representative who can't help you anyways, look no further! Seriously I could go on all day, but to make it short: Worst customer service known to mankind Horrible Coverage Phones are a piece and constantly having issues Most expensive and for no reason! Doesn't make sense to pay more, for less! less coverage, less data and less customer service. If there was a way to mark them a .5 I would have!"""
217,"""What a nightmare! So many errors necessitating so many calls, each with its long hold times and nightmare music clips and promos. I bought a Samsung Entro on the VM website, receiving email confirmation, then an email telling me there was a problem processing the order and I needed to call. After listening to horrible hold music and promos) I was told the phone was on backorder and wouldn't be available for at least 6 months. So the salesperson cancelled the and placed my order for a Samsung Galaxy Victory. Then I got an email saying the Entro was shipping. I assumed it was another mistake. It wasn't. The Entro arrived. Now that I had the Entro, I called to cancel the Galaxy Victory. Again, the horrible hold music and promos before the order was cancelled. A few days later the Galaxy Victory arrived. I called to find out how to return it. After talking to two agents (horrible hold music and promos twice), I was told I would have to pay to ship it back, then I could call yet again (more horrible hold music and promos) to request a refund on the postage. I couldn't take anymore. I was quite rude to the agent and hung up on her. The service is good (and cheap) but don't buy your phones from The Company!"""
693,"""When we were still happy with it, it was when they were giving us good service. However about a year ago, we decided we wanted to quit because they'd changed somethings and wouldn't give us the unlimited internet we'd had and whatnot, which you could say was partially our fault for cancelling it but when we called a week later they told us too bad, but the bill was getting to so as I said we wanted to quit. Now first they told us just wait until March for one of the phones, June for the other, and the last needed to be in 2 years because it was the newest. Now, we weren't too happy but we dealt with it, come March they said oh no, its 2014, come June, oh no its July, and now we're just fed up and happily. We told them to send it in writing. Come July, my family was spitting fire because they were trying to get us to stay and trying to feed us a bunch of B.S. I recommend to stay away from The Company"""
46,"""Worst experience of any cell phone company. Out and out lied to me that the phone I was buying had web service and then sold me a plan for web service. I was promised that they could port my old number ....WRONG. I was promised a 30 day money back guarantee, WRONG. I am now out for the cost of the phone AND data plan and haven't even used the phone once. oh, and now have shipping charges to send it back. No offense to the people of Malaysia which is where the call center is I believe....couldn't understand a single word of one person and kept calling back until I found someone I could understand.Â """
356,"""been with them for 10 years. They are great! I had one problem with their connectivity quality and it was resolved loading a new PPL. I have an inexpensive plan, get coverage all over the USA, while people are spending 100s my bill is about $58, $6 of that is text messaging which I don't use all the much and $7 in taxes. They always answer the phone and solve my problem. NOT looking forward to being forced to go to The Company."""
266,I been with The Company since I bought my first android and the service has given me awsom coverage and its cheaper with the best monthly payment oppurtunities compare to other carriers and now I am using my 5th phone IPHONE 5 and The Company is the only carrier that has the cheapest monthly plan I have been really blessed by getting The Company ! love it..
392,I can't believe how unprofessional the staff is. My phone LCD (not the screen) cracked for some unknown reason. I went to get it replaced at the The Company store and they sent me to their repair center to get it replaced assuring me that they would have a replacement. I get to the The Company repair center and they stated that they do not carry the Galaxy S4 32GB and that I would have to call Phone Claim... I call phone claim and I order a replacement 32GB and they send me a 16GB Galaxy S4... I send it back and have to wait 6 days for it to get back to them... I wait the 6 days then call and they state that they received the phone and that the right version will be sent to me and arrive within 2 business days. It's been two business days and no phone... I call PhoneClaim and they stated that the phone has not been shipped... I ask why and they said it was not approved.. The lady on the phone sensed my stress and anger (I guess) and decided to speak to her manager and gets the phone shipped... (supposedly) we will see what happens... Service Sucks!!!
267,I can't say the rest of these reviews are real but I have been a no contract customer for over 5 years now and have not had any problems with the company or phones had sprint but couldn't afford them so I am glad to be out of their contract both myself and my son have the LG optimus elite and aside from normal battery issues will keep The Company mobile calls are not dropped sound is normal as any other phone um I would recommend them for many reasons
423,I have been a customer of this service for over 9 years and sometime in the last 2 years customer service and the quality of service has decreased greatly.
447,I have been using The Company for a little over a month. Love the value. $60/month for unlimited everything compared to my $120 with The Company. Call quality has been okay as I have had only 2 dropped calls in the time I have been with them and so far no major concerns with customer service. I get texts several days before reminding me to top up so I don't have service interruptions.
179,I have had service with The Company for almost two years. It's not the best but it is cheap. I finally upgraded my phone from the lg optimus to samsung galaxy. Really better phone all together. But know I'm trying to put service back on my old phone. And it's not taking. I have called tech support 5 times and received and ridicules excuse why its not working. Each tech has done exactly the same 5 steps the previous tech did. Didn't solve the problem. They document that I have had problems from the begining. Yet they can't solve the problem but they are great at passing the buck to another tech. So know I'm waiting 24-72 hours for a call back for that tech to reset the phone and still have the same problems. These phones are not complicated. There is only so much you can do before they realise it is the phone. I've told them it is the phone. Well know I have to clear my schedule for a phone call. Great!
615,I spent a couple hours on the phone with apple and at&t today about my boyfriend's lost phone. I kept getting comments from both ends about why one provider was better than the other. Apple put me on hold for a LONG time and the advice they gave me was something I had already done. Karen Johnson from The Company was awesome and patient and actually gave me good answers and advice.
323,Overall I am very satisfied with The Company. I had The Company for about 3 years and switched to another company because there was a better phone that I wanted. I stayed there until my contract ran out and switched back to The Company because the coverage and price was so much better. I've been here for about 4 years and don't anticipate switching. I do wish they would get a larger selection of phones.
378,Terrible!!!! I stayed up all night and was second in line to buy the iphone 5s. While I was about to purchase it the sales rep said that because my area code isn't local that he couldn't give me the upgrade discount. Are you freaking kidding me? I just upgraded 6 months ago at the same location. I even called the call center and they said there was nothing they can do. I was just in the store a few days ago too and they didn't tell me that. I don't have one good reason to stay with at&t. As soon as I can get the 5s with The Company then I am terminating my contract with at&t. Please stay far away from at&t!! Horrible customer service.
525,The company's billing is very high and when they charge extra their explanation is confusing and they never send the bill at home the customer service people seen to be answering from a script they dont do much to help their customers I think is because I am under a contract. I think I can find a company at a better cost and the same service some where else most of my friends pay less than I do.
368,The manager in this store is rude like hell.only if he sees a beautiful woman he's a dog right away give all she needs.I really feel that this man in this location is a dick just because I'm an older woman I need to wait and as soon someone younger get into the store he give all the time and she's finish first than me I 'm very disappointing.
86,They care about me as a customer. They treat me with respect and I can tell they want to keep me as a customer. They also have the best network in Chicago.
471,This company is great! I have the National 1000 plan and get national incoming calls any where in us along with national nights and weekends starting @7pm and where in us along with local m2m and only pay $79.99 for 3 phones on this plan. this gives me the freedom to use my phone while on travel and vacation! i also have a blackberry plan on my account. these prices have become cheaper since first coming out which is awesome! i have only had maybe one dropped call since i got there service maybe 2 tops. My internet is fast and i use it all the time while out of town or even shopping to look things up! battery swap is great i can swap my battery if mine is running slow at any us cell store! If i ever have any billing questions i call or stop into store and sales reps are always very friendly and nice helping me resolve any problems that i have. i have never had to have any of our phones sent out for warranty and they always last us at least till our contract is up sometimes even longer!
25,We have been customers for over 5 years and will not switch. We have no reason to. We can't seem to find a better deal or better service anywhere else.
163,i have been with Another Company since they came to baltimore. i love them i pay 60.00 a month for unlimited everything and my warantee i have had a problem only one time with my phone and thats because i dropped it but i went to my local corporate store and for 20.00 i recieved a brand new phone. the oonly thing i dont like is theyy dont have a phone upgrade you pay flat out the price of the phone. if they fix that and give a discount for phone up grades they would get a perfect 10
750,Â I've been with iCompany - Another Company for 4 years now. I have never had a problem - never dropped a call I have free roaming free long distance which is great for my family inutah west virginia etc. I even get roll over minutes. Every time I called customer service they have always helped me and even have a 24/7 late niht number there always on call - this is the best plan / company I have ever had I plan to stay with them. The only thing I dont like is there plans arnt cheap but you get great service
451,"""-Badest customer service -Poor reception -Lots of drop off calls -Bad phones (may be factory refurb sold as new) -Long wait time if you call customer service, many times call disconnect or representative will put on hold for not less 30 min. or (s)he will"""
553,"""After 2 and a half years with one of the big companies, it is such a pleasure to deal with The Company. There was no pressure at all in choosing a phone. In fact, when I looked at more expensive ones, the representative encouraged me to look at something less flashy because it met my needs better. I appreciated that. There have been a couple of small errors in billing but they were quick to correct and credit my account. What a change from my old company where they gave me incorrect information,over-charged me $600, argued with me and said they were just too busy to go over the bill with me. Sometimes I have to wait to get help. But there is someone there who welcomes me, takes my name, offers to get water or coffee and just makes me feel valued. The company has even invested in comfortable chairs for customers who have to wait. I love The Company."""
457,"""BAD SERVICE! poor customer service! Not at all willing to listen and resolve issues. Sarcastic, nasty and should be drummed out of the business! Daughter has called and called and talked to several employees and they are sarcastic and demeaning to her! Not exactly the way a reputable company works. Disgusting."""
579,"""Beware of The Company. It's no more than a bunch of thieves. It took money from my credit card in Nov. When I complained, they told me the money will be applied back to my credit card within 24-48 hours, which did not happen. So far I had to called 25 times and go to the local store 4 times to get my money back. Most of the time they promised me I would receive the money in 24-48 hours. They acknowledged that they wrongfully took my money, but hesitated to return it. What a bunch of crooked thieves!"""
366,"""Buyer beware. You have no recourse with Another Company if you ever have any service problems. I have a new phone past the 30 days (5 months old). I am told I will have to wait a minimum of 5 business days to get a replacement phone during which time I will be totally without service. I travel 100 miles + daily and rely on my phone for emergencies and in the event I have car problems on the road. I will receive a refurbished phone (someone else's problem phone) and no additional extension to the warranty. The CS reps were very nice but are not allowed to go outside Another Company rules regardless of the circumstances. Another Company is and has always been a very uncaring and unconcerned organization when it comes to customer satisfaction. Their overall ratings bare this statement out from other surveys, and they still make no effort to improve or to take care of long term customers that they have never had any problems with. What does this tell you about Another Company? Draw your own conclusion."""
365,"""By far biggest bang for the buck. I do think they need to removing texting fees, but still by far best value for money in State 1 and State y."""
759,"""Carriers are evil; greed based, work with people to sue our kids, charge use twice or more for the same data/access (on example tethering) and bribe senators to take away our freedoms. Use alternative prepay options -- keep your freedoms and save money over the life of a typical plan."""
725,"""Coverage sucks. They claim to have coverage on their map in places they do not. The data only works half the time, the other half of the time it will endlessly load but never successfully access a webpage. If you have a new period of service beginning on the 9th and you have an automatic payment method on file, they will start trying to bill you on the 7th. Remember, you have already PAID for service, THROUGH the 8th, but if they have a problem processing your payment on the 7th they will cut your service off and send you an automated text message letting you know. That's stealing as far as I'm concerned. Also, customer service routes you to India, where even the most basic concerns are either misinterpreted due to language barriers or willfully ignored due to policy. Hard to tell."""
276,"""Dear God: PLEASE tell all these carriers that it is better to have 8mbps EVERYWHERE than to have 23 in one place and .5 in another. Just give me a network where if I have a signal, I have good speed. Not faster than cable, just good solid speed. Tmo is probably the only one capable of delivering this right away, but they still have Edge in too many places. I would have preferred if they had bypassed LTE for now and just rolled out HSPA+ 42 everywhere."""
642,"""My family has been with The Company for YEARS and I mean years and have never had any problems with the customer service or service quality. In truth we live in the mountains and I get better signal on my phone then my friend does on her Verison phone. As for the internet phones I JUST upgraded my phone to a huawei Ascend 2 a couple days ago so i dont have a strong oppinion on it yet. I'm just saying you can read all the reviews you want but the best thing to do is to try it for yourself. I personally love The Company and suggest it strongly to my friends. I went traveling to the east coast two years back and went all up and down the coast and had reception ALL the way. As well as it didn't charge me extra roaming fees. Personally I love it. Sincerely, Loyal to a T FYI for all you out there no phone company is perfect. There will ALWAYS be problems no matter what one your with."""
791,"""First the Indian guy on the phone has the wrong address and keeps telling me i already have an account with U-verse before i even signed up. I kept telling him he had the wrong address but he didn't get it, because when I called back the next day and spoke to an American they still had the wrong address. Finally i was able to clear it up and get started. The first installation guy was supposed to come inside to make sure everything was ready for service I was told to be home for specific hours and had to take off work. I thought the guy never showed so i called and apparently he was just checking the outside of the building and left. When i wasn't able to get a signal with a self install i called them back they sent me a dumb tech who couldn't figure out how to install it either. He said somebody would be coming the next day who could fix it. I asked when and he didn't know just said to wait for a call. Later the next day my neighbor tells me a guy from at&t was on the first floor of the apartment, (I have no buzzers working and specified i must be called to be let in) and i live on the third floor. My neighbor said he waited less than 2 minutes and left without calling me. I swiftly canceled the service and got almost all my money back. During the week i ordered i was suggested to sign up for a hotline u can call to help u self install but if i didn't cancel after a week i would be charged $10. This company is hired by at&t to help customers but even though i never had service i was charged and couldn't get my money back. I had to spend an hour on the phone just to get the company name number and cancel. My last nightmare happened when i returned the modem ups lost it and i was charged $150 it was taken straight out of my account since i was forced to sign a contract with auto something to do with my low credit rating. I called asked what happened they said its lost and they would call me back. They never did two weeks later i found the receipt with the tracking number so i called them back. They got the modem, and said they were sending a request for a full rebate. I get a call today and they sent me a check for $100. I was charged $150. So i had to send another request for my $50 check they are calling me friday to make sure it goes through. Worst experience of my life called xfinity they were there in two days installed in 1 and a half hours and havent had any problems"""

They sat with me on the phone for over 2 hours, going over it line by line and crediting back for every 3rd party purchase/download. It was a lot of time I didn't really have, but the lady, Lisa Goss, was absolutely amazing...patient and very, very nice. I was mad...you can't imagine how mad...and she was just great. Their customer service is usually really good anyway though. I think that is why we stick with them even with the other stuff. You just can't find good customer service anymore.Â """

Their service is run out of India and the technicians are difficult to understand. When problems are FINALLY resolved, there's a new problem a few weeks later. Don't waste your time or money.

I wasn't satisfied with that answer so I called back, the next person said they have to open a case and it could take 3-4 weeks for me to get a refund, I wasn't satisfied with that either, I called again to get a different person and this rep. told me it would be 7 days before I get refunded...

405,"""I have been a The Company customer for a number of years, dating back to the other co days. The real problem with this company is a total lack of after-sales customer service: whether it be commercial or technical. It is extremely difficult (almost impossible) to obtain a knowledgeable agent to solve any problem. Generally the personnel are badly trained and badly informed. The real test of a company is not when everything is going well (as it should do!) but how they deal with a problem. The Company scores very, very low. In summary the service is ok as long as it works, but as soon as you have a problem you can not count on them for help. There are many other better phone companies to choose from!"""
338,"""I have been a customer of The Company for 8 years now. For $100 a month including taxes I have a family plan that includes two lines and 1000 minutes a month. I do not text or use the internet. The service has been o.k. for the most part. I get reception almost everywhere in NYC but I sometimes lose calls in parts of stores. The voice mail has recently become a problem. I will occasionally get messages a day after they were sent! This has cost me money. I have accumulated over 7000 rollover minutes. However, they are useless if I want to change my plan since I will lose them if I change plans. The customer service has been friendly on the 3-4 occasions that I have needed them. However, my calls to them were informational and not much was accomplished. The phones that I have received have functioned for the duration of the contract. On my last contract I had a Samsung phone where the screen went blank towards the end of the last contract. I waited until the end of the contract to get a new phone. For the money that I am paying, I should be getting internet service included. I am planning to switch to another carrier!"""

The service is nothing short of terrible, I live in the city and barely get one bar at times, and when i do miraculously have full bars it is still slower than molasses. On top of the horrible service, my phone would send out the same text up to six times, and sometimes i would send / receive texts the next day!! For your own sanity do not use The Company"""
385,"""I honestly don't understand all the negative comments regarding Another Company. I have had them as a carrier now for several years. I came from The Company who had consistently messed up my bill and over charged me and screwed things up all the time. They only seemed to be about the almighty dollar no matter how they had to get it. Another Company on the other hand has been great!! I have personally found that they will go way above and beyond when it comes to customer service. I had previously owned an HTC Aria. It was a complete lemon of a phone. I went thru the rules and as a result had three different phones sent to me via the warranty. By the time I was ready for phone number four I said there is no way I will take a fourth Aria, obviously it's just a poorly made phone. At which point, I asked to exchange for a Samsung Galaxy and they approved. I was thrilled with that phone and hung on to it until recently upgrading to the Galaxy Note, my new all time favorite phone EVER. Any time I have ever had questions about my bill, phone anything, Another Company has always taken care of my questions or concerns immediately...many times giving me a nice credit on my bill without even asking. Out of all the cell companies I have been with, hands down Another Company has the best customer service. I truly believe they care about their customers and keeping them! They have found ways to lower my monthly bill as well. I have never had a rude or unwilling customer service rep. I highly recommend this company. As far as paying your bill, simply download their app and pay your bill right thru there. Doesn't cost anything. Also, when I have had tough financial months, they are more than willing to work with you, rather than like many companies who just merely shut you down. If you make a payment arrangement with them and stick to it, they will make arrangements with you anytime and never interrupt service. I would never change carriers for nothing! Oh, and as far as quality cell phone service/range....I've never had a dropped call or anything. Very clear, consistant service and phone calls.

170,"""I just changed my plan to unlimited minutes, which was very easy to do. However, be aware that they make the change retroactive so that it takes effect from your normal billing date. For me this means that even though my billing cycle is half done they are billing me at the new unlimited rate for the entire billing cycle. In other words, I am paying for two weeks of a service which I never used. This is unfair and I would like to see The Company prorate these charges so that we pay for what we get."""

Well, now at&t wanted to run my credit for the third time within one week. I was approved two times prior. I felt that didn't make any sense. The rep stated that if I allow them to run my credit again, I may receive a better promotion as a new customer. As far as I was concerned I was still a new customer, since I never intercepted the merchandise and it was returned to them unopened. I never received any service. That was a true indicator of the customer service I would receive if I were to continue to proceed to receive the service....

As a regional carrier, their coverage has never been the greatest and their phone offerings are behind the curve and sometimes really disappointing in quality, but their superior customer service was what kept me as a loyal customer. Until recently. It seems they are now spending a lot of money advertising about their happy customers and apparently a lot less money on actual customer service. Today when I had an issue, I was transferred several times, treated with alternating rudeness or apathy and no one cared to fix my issue. And, in fact, they never did fix it. Even when I asked to speak to a customer service supervisor. Bottom line? The only thing they really had going for them was their great customer service. Since they don't have that anymore, there is no reason to consider them.

When I told her my phone did not have a data card she told me all phones had data card. When I asked her to tell me where it was in the Galaxy Nexus she then told me it did not have a data card I could remove. Went back to store where clerk told me to Bluetooth pictures to new phone but after several minutes of trying told me it would not work but she did not know why.

Then it automatically went into silent mode every time it went into sleep mode, and now it will neither send nor receive texts from anyone, except my phone itself.

Our phones didn't even last the year before they started dying out, but they wouldn't let us purchase new ones for anything less than $250. Then we moved to another town and couldn't even get service in our own home. So now that we've cancelled our service 8 months early, they are trying to charge us $450 PER PHONE!!!

Most recently I got on and had the cheeriest, friendliest and genuinely eager person to help me with a billing issue (I was concerned about how much I'd be billed for accepting collect calls) She helped me, and it turned out I was billed nothing extra, But during our conversation when I mentioned I might have to lealve Another Company because I couldn't afford my plan (they do need to work on more affordable plans) she offered me a 40$ credit because of my loyalty thus far.

747,Horrible company to deal with. Defective phone arrived late. They wanted me to pay for returning a defective phone. You call them and wait hours for a live person. They then tell you they have to transfer you to a different department - they then disconnect you. You start all over again. Two hours later you are still nowhere. Ridiculous. I will never use them again. Ever. I would rather not have a cell phone than deal with them. They should be sued in a class action and have to pay millions of dollars. Even that would not be enough punishment for the hell they put me through.

720,I can't believe how unprofessional the staff is. My phone LCD (not the screen) cracked for some unknown reason. I went to get it replaced at the The Company store and they sent me to their repair center to get it replaced assuring me that they would have a replacement. I get to the The Company repair center and they stated that they do not carry the Galaxy S4 32GB and that I would have to call Phone Claim... I call phone claim and I order a replacement 32GB and they send me a 16GB Galaxy S4... I send it back and have to wait 6 days for it to get back to them... I wait the 6 days then call and they state that they received the phone and that the right version will be sent to me and arrive within 2 business days. It's been two business days and no phone... I call PhoneClaim and they stated that the phone has not been shipped... I ask why and they said it was not approved.. The lady on the phone sensed my stress and anger (I guess) and decided to speak to her manager and gets the phone shipped... (supposedly) we will see what happens... Service Sucks!!!
788,I can't say the rest of these reviews are real but I have been a no contract customer for over 5 years now and have not had any problems with the company or phones had sprint but couldn't afford them so I am glad to be out of their contract both myself and my son have the LG optimus elite and aside from normal battery issues will keep The Company mobile calls are not dropped sound is normal as any other phone um I would recommend them for many reasons
94,I have been a customer of this service for over 9 years and sometime in the last 2 years customer service and the quality of service has decreased greatly.
104,I have been using The Company for a little over a month. Love the value. $60/month for unlimited everything compared to my $120 with The Company. Call quality has been okay as I have had only 2 dropped calls in the time I have been with them and so far no major concerns with customer service. I get texts several days before reminding me to top up so I don't have service interruptions.
578,I have had service with The Company for almost two years. It's not the best but it is cheap. I finally upgraded my phone from the lg optimus to samsung galaxy. Really better phone all together. But know I'm trying to put service back on my old phone. And it's not taking. I have called tech support 5 times and received and ridicules excuse why its not working. Each tech has done exactly the same 5 steps the previous tech did. Didn't solve the problem. They document that I have had problems from the begining. Yet they can't solve the problem but they are great at passing the buck to another tech. So know I'm waiting 24-72 hours for a call back for that tech to reset the phone and still have the same problems. These phones are not complicated. There is only so much you can do before they realise it is the phone. I've told them it is the phone. Well know I have to clear my schedule for a phone call. Great!
688,I spent a couple hours on the phone with apple and at&t today about my boyfriend's lost phone. I kept getting comments from both ends about why one provider was better than the other. Apple put me on hold for a LONG time and the advice they gave me was something I had already done. Karen Johnson from The Company was awesome and patient and actually gave me good answers and advice.
628,Overall I am very satisfied with The Company. I had The Company for about 3 years and switched to another company because there was a better phone that I wanted. I stayed there until my contract ran out and switched back to The Company because the coverage and price was so much better. I've been here for about 4 years and don't anticipate switching. I do wish they would get a larger selection of phones.
625,Terrible!!!! I stayed up all night and was second in line to buy the iphone 5s. While I was about to purchase it the sales rep said that because my area code isn't local that he couldn't give me the upgrade discount. Are you freaking kidding me? I just upgraded 6 months ago at the same location. I even called the call center and they said there was nothing they can do. I was just in the store a few days ago too and they didn't tell me that. I don't have one good reason to stay with at&t. As soon as I can get the 5s with The Company then I am terminating my contract with at&t. Please stay far away from at&t!! Horrible customer service.
757,The company's billing is very high and when they charge extra their explanation is confusing and they never send the bill at home the customer service people seen to be answering from a script they dont do much to help their customers I think is because I am under a contract. I think I can find a company at a better cost and the same service some where else most of my friends pay less than I do.
281,The manager in this store is rude like hell.only if he sees a beautiful woman he's a dog right away give all she needs.I really feel that this man in this location is a dick just because I'm an older woman I need to wait and as soon someone younger get into the store he give all the time and she's finish first than me I 'm very disappointing.
559,They care about me as a customer. They treat me with respect and I can tell they want to keep me as a customer. They also have the best network in Chicago.
32,This company is great! I have the National 1000 plan and get national incoming calls any where in us along with national nights and weekends starting @7pm and where in us along with local m2m and only pay $79.99 for 3 phones on this plan. this gives me the freedom to use my phone while on travel and vacation! i also have a blackberry plan on my account. these prices have become cheaper since first coming out which is awesome! i have only had maybe one dropped call since i got there service maybe 2 tops. My internet is fast and i use it all the time while out of town or even shopping to look things up! battery swap is great i can swap my battery if mine is running slow at any us cell store! If i ever have any billing questions i call or stop into store and sales reps are always very friendly and nice helping me resolve any problems that i have. i have never had to have any of our phones sent out for warranty and they always last us at least till our contract is up sometimes even longer!
45,We have been customers for over 5 years and will not switch. We have no reason to. We can't seem to find a better deal or better service anywhere else.
503,i have been with Another Company since they came to baltimore. i love them i pay 60.00 a month for unlimited everything and my warantee i have had a problem only one time with my phone and thats because i dropped it but i went to my local corporate store and for 20.00 i recieved a brand new phone. the oonly thing i dont like is theyy dont have a phone upgrade you pay flat out the price of the phone. if they fix that and give a discount for phone up grades they would get a perfect 10
298,Â I've been with iCompany - Another Company for 4 years now. I have never had a problem - never dropped a call I have free roaming free long distance which is great for my family inutah west virginia etc. I even get roll over minutes. Every time I called customer service they have always helped me and even have a 24/7 late niht number there always on call - this is the best plan / company I have ever had I plan to stay with them. The only thing I dont like is there plans arnt cheap but you get great service
78,"""-Badest customer service -Poor reception -Lots of drop off calls -Bad phones (may be factory refurb sold as new) -Long wait time if you call customer service, many times call disconnect or representative will put on hold for not less 30 min. or (s)he will"""
263,"""After 2 and a half years with one of the big companies, it is such a pleasure to deal with The Company. There was no pressure at all in choosing a phone. In fact, when I looked at more expensive ones, the representative encouraged me to look at something less flashy because it met my needs better. I appreciated that. There have been a couple of small errors in billing but they were quick to correct and credit my account. What a change from my old company where they gave me incorrect information,over-charged me $600, argued with me and said they were just too busy to go over the bill with me. Sometimes I have to wait to get help. But there is someone there who welcomes me, takes my name, offers to get water or coffee and just makes me feel valued. The company has even invested in comfortable chairs for customers who have to wait. I love The Company."""
278,"""BAD SERVICE! poor customer service! Not at all willing to listen and resolve issues. Sarcastic, nasty and should be drummed out of the business! Daughter has called and called and talked to several employees and they are sarcastic and demeaning to her! Not exactly the way a reputable company works. Disgusting."""
123,"""Beware of The Company. It's no more than a bunch of thieves. It took money from my credit card in Nov. When I complained, they told me the money will be applied back to my credit card within 24-48 hours, which did not happen. So far I had to called 25 times and go to the local store 4 times to get my money back. Most of the time they promised me I would receive the money in 24-48 hours. They acknowledged that they wrongfully took my money, but hesitated to return it. What a bunch of crooked thieves!"""
692,"""Buyer beware. You have no recourse with Another Company if you ever have any service problems. I have a new phone past the 30 days (5 months old). I am told I will have to wait a minimum of 5 business days to get a replacement phone during which time I will be totally without service. I travel 100 miles + daily and rely on my phone for emergencies and in the event I have car problems on the road. I will receive a refurbished phone (someone else's problem phone) and no additional extension to the warranty. The CS reps were very nice but are not allowed to go outside Another Company rules regardless of the circumstances. Another Company is and has always been a very uncaring and unconcerned organization when it comes to customer satisfaction. Their overall ratings bare this statement out from other surveys, and they still make no effort to improve or to take care of long term customers that they have never had any problems with. What does this tell you about Another Company? Draw your own conclusion."""
753,"""By far biggest bang for the buck. I do think they need to removing texting fees, but still by far best value for money in State 1 and State y."""
528,"""Carriers are evil; greed based, work with people to sue our kids, charge use twice or more for the same data/access (on example tethering) and bribe senators to take away our freedoms. Use alternative prepay options -- keep your freedoms and save money over the life of a typical plan."""
767,"""Coverage sucks. They claim to have coverage on their map in places they do not. The data only works half the time, the other half of the time it will endlessly load but never successfully access a webpage. If you have a new period of service beginning on the 9th and you have an automatic payment method on file, they will start trying to bill you on the 7th. Remember, you have already PAID for service, THROUGH the 8th, but if they have a problem processing your payment on the 7th they will cut your service off and send you an automated text message letting you know. That's stealing as far as I'm concerned. Also, customer service routes you to India, where even the most basic concerns are either misinterpreted due to language barriers or willfully ignored due to policy. Hard to tell."""
383,"""Dear God: PLEASE tell all these carriers that it is better to have 8mbps EVERYWHERE than to have 23 in one place and .5 in another. Just give me a network where if I have a signal, I have good speed. Not faster than cable, just good solid speed. Tmo is probably the only one capable of delivering this right away, but they still have Edge in too many places. I would have preferred if they had bypassed LTE for now and just rolled out HSPA+ 42 everywhere."""
162,"""My family has been with The Company for YEARS and I mean years and have never had any problems with the customer service or service quality. In truth we live in the mountains and I get better signal on my phone then my friend does on her Verison phone. As for the internet phones I JUST upgraded my phone to a huawei Ascend 2 a couple days ago so i dont have a strong oppinion on it yet. I'm just saying you can read all the reviews you want but the best thing to do is to try it for yourself. I personally love The Company and suggest it strongly to my friends. I went traveling to the east coast two years back and went all up and down the coast and had reception ALL the way. As well as it didn't charge me extra roaming fees. Personally I love it. Sincerely, Loyal to a T FYI for all you out there no phone company is perfect. There will ALWAYS be problems no matter what one your with."""
772,"""My fiance and i signed a 2-year agreement in December of 2011 with brand new phones. Our monthly bill was $180, which we soon changed to the share everything plan but they were still charging us $165; every month they would tell us we were going over in our data, but when we would check it ourselves on our phones or by going in to a store we were fine, but yet they would still charge us for it. Our phones didn't even last the year before they started dying out, but they wouldn't let us purchase new ones for anything less than $250. Then we moved to another town and couldn't even get service in our own home. So now that we've cancelled our service 8 months early, they are trying to charge us $450 PER PHONE!!! Our contract clearly states that they can charge us UP TO $350 PER ACCOUNT, definitely not $450 and definitely not per phone. Signing a contract with The Company was nothing but a constant hassle and rip-off. I wouldn't recommend them to anyone."""
698,"""Okay So The Company... is a bit overpriced, and there have been a couple of times i've chatted with someone on customer assistance that clearly didn't quite grasp what I was talking about. But I've been with them since 2006 and seriously that has happened maybe twice. Most recently I got on and had the cheeriest, friendliest and genuinely eager person to help me with a billing issue (I was concerned about how much I'd be billed for accepting collect calls) She helped me, and it turned out I was billed nothing extra, But during our conversation when I mentioned I might have to lealve Another Company because I couldn't afford my plan (they do need to work on more affordable plans) she offered me a 40$ credit because of my loyalty thus far. I am seriously pleased with Another Company and always have been, if I switch companies it is strictly a financial move."""
483,"""Overall, if you are in the East and Midwest, I highly recommend this company. I actually ENJOY going into their stores and looking at new phones. They never push anything. Five Stars out of Five."""
668,"""First the Indian guy on the phone has the wrong address and keeps telling me i already have an account with U-verse before i even signed up. I kept telling him he had the wrong address but he didn't get it, because when I called back the next day and spoke to an American they still had the wrong address. Finally i was able to clear it up and get started. The first installation guy was supposed to come inside to make sure everything was ready for service I was told to be home for specific hours and had to take off work. I thought the guy never showed so i called and apparently he was just checking the outside of the building and left. When i wasn't able to get a signal with a self install i called them back they sent me a dumb tech who couldn't figure out how to install it either. He said somebody would be coming the next day who could fix it. I asked when and he didn't know just said to wait for a call. Later the next day my neighbor tells me a guy from at&t was on the first floor of the apartment, (I have no buzzers working and specified i must be called to be let in) and i live on the third floor. My neighbor said he waited less than 2 minutes and left without calling me. I swiftly canceled the service and got almost all my money back. During the week i ordered i was suggested to sign up for a hotline u can call to help u self install but if i didn't cancel after a week i would be charged $10. This company is hired by at&t to help customers but even though i never had service i was charged and couldn't get my money back. I had to spend an hour on the phone just to get the company name number and cancel. My last nightmare happened when i returned the modem ups lost it and i was charged $150 it was taken straight out of my account since i was forced to sign a contract with auto something to do with my low credit rating. I called asked what happened they said its lost and they would call me back. They never did two weeks later i found the receipt with the tracking number so i called them back. They got the modem, and said they were sending a request for a full rebate. I get a call today and they sent me a check for $100. I was charged $150. So i had to send another request for my $50 check they are calling me friday to make sure it goes through. Worst experience of my life called xfinity they were there in two days installed in 1 and a half hours and havent had any problems"""

They sat with me on the phone for over 2 hours, going over it line by line and crediting back for every 3rd party purchase/download. It was a lot of time I didn't really have, but the lady, Lisa Goss, was absolutely amazing...patient and very, very nice. I was mad...you can't imagine how mad...and she was just great. Their customer service is usually really good anyway though. I think that is why we stick with them even with the other stuff. You just can't find good customer service anymore.Â """

It ultimate waste of money. Also, their customer care behave very rudely, when I went for any issue."""

Their service is run out of India and the technicians are difficult to understand. When problems are FINALLY resolved, there's a new problem a few weeks later. Don't waste your time or money.

597,"""I have been a The Company customer for a number of years, dating back to the other co days. The real problem with this company is a total lack of after-sales customer service: whether it be commercial or technical. It is extremely difficult (almost impossible) to obtain a knowledgeable agent to solve any problem. Generally the personnel are badly trained and badly informed. The real test of a company is not when everything is going well (as it should do!) but how they deal with a problem. The Company scores very, very low. In summary the service is ok as long as it works, but as soon as you have a problem you can not count on them for help. There are many other better phone companies to choose from!"""
722,"""I have been a customer of The Company for 8 years now. For $100 a month including taxes I have a family plan that includes two lines and 1000 minutes a month.

The voice mail has recently become a problem. I will occasionally get messages a day after they were sent! This has cost me money. I have accumulated over 7000 rollover minutes. However, they are useless if I want to change my plan since I will lose them if I change plans. The customer service has been friendly on the 3-4 occasions that I have needed them. However, my calls to them were informational and not much was accomplished. The phones that I have received have functioned for the duration of the contract. On my last contract I had a Samsung phone where the screen went blank towards the end of the last contract. I waited until the end of the contract to get a new phone.

499,"""I honestly don't understand all the negative comments regarding Another Company. I have had them as a carrier now for several years. I came from The Company who had consistently messed up my bill and over charged me and screwed things up all the time. They only seemed to be about the almighty dollar no matter how they had to get it. Another Company on the other hand has been great!! I have personally found that they will go way above and beyond when it comes to customer service. I had previously owned an HTC Aria. It was a complete lemon of a phone. I went thru the rules and as a result had three different phones sent to me via the warranty. By the time I was ready for phone number four I said there is no way I will take a fourth Aria, obviously it's just a poorly made phone. At which point, I asked to exchange for a Samsung Galaxy and they approved. I was thrilled with that phone and hung on to it until recently upgrading to the Galaxy Note, my new all time favorite phone EVER. Any time I have ever had questions about my bill, phone anything, Another Company has always taken care of my questions or concerns immediately...many times giving me a nice credit on my bill without even asking. Out of all the cell companies I have been with, hands down Another Company has the best customer service. I truly believe they care about their customers and keeping them! They have found ways to lower my monthly bill as well. I have never had a rude or unwilling customer service rep. I highly recommend this company. As far as paying your bill, simply download their app and pay your bill right thru there. Doesn't cost anything. Also, when I have had tough financial months, they are more than willing to work with you, rather than like many companies who just merely shut you down. If you make a payment arrangement with them and stick to it, they will make arrangements with you anytime and never interrupt service. I would never change carriers for nothing! Oh, and as far as quality cell phone service/range....I've never had a dropped call or anything. Very clear, consistant service and phone calls. If ppl are posting all negative about Another Company, I really question their situation...and I promise, I do not work for Another Company, never have and am not paid in any way to post this. Just a very happy customer who have been with them about 9 yrs."""
679,"""I just changed my plan to unlimited minutes, which was very easy to do. However, be aware that they make the change retroactive so that it takes effect from your normal billing date. For me this means that even though my billing cycle is half done they are billing me at the new unlimited rate for the entire billing cycle. In other words, I am paying for two weeks of a service which I never used. This is unfair and I would like to see The Company prorate these charges so that we pay for what we get."""

That same day I received an email stating the order I had just placed was cancelled due to dual orders placed. I called to conflict issue and place yet another order. Well, now at&t wanted to run my credit for the third time within one week. I was approved two times prior. I felt that didn't make any sense. The rep stated that if I allow them to run my credit again, I may receive a better promotion as a new customer. As far as I was concerned I was still a new customer, since I never intercepted the merchandise and it was returned to them unopened. I never received any service.

After weeks of researching for a perfect plan for me and my family I found The Company to be to best option to suite our needs. after many years with att and The Company and after switching to The Company had really been a significiant saving I had figured out that The Companys phones are bit more exspensive but with the plan in really pays off. And dont even go with the service it is great have never not had 4g and always have good bars.  ""I am so disapointed of this company, since the moment I wanted to buy an iphone and join them I have a PO BOX as mailing address and was not possible to purchase it because of that. They made me waste my time over the phone with actually 4 representatives and the last one told me the truth. Comon The Company mobil If your goal is became a big phone company you have to pass to XXI century"""
784,"""I switched from The Companye because of its Bad Customer Service, bars, droped calls. Made me wait 2 hours Paying for 2 phones $220 no addons. I joined iCompany who's customer care actually cares they fixed my problems in just a matter of minutes and were very nice. I didn't have to wait the next bill cycle to get my plan or features changed. I get bars everywhere tmobile was not able to. People told me Tmobile's problem is temp. and will be fixed in about a month two months later still like that. I even talked to my friend who is an manager at tmobile(he doesn't use tmobile himself hates it) and he said this problem isn't a temp. problem this will be a problem. Att has higher pricing than tmobile but is way worth it..."""
539,"""I switched to this carrier from a previous carrier. The Company has great coverage but dropped calls occasionally. Phone selection and customer service are the worst. In any The Company store mise well have an hour or more to spare to do anything. I switched to a smaller service company with way better plans, cheaper, and same phone selection and better customer service"""
373,"""I think if you're not sure which carrier to go with, ask people who live in your area. The most important to ongoing satisfaction: """"do you get reception? and do the calls drop?"""" Having more minutes and a cooler phone won't count if you can't get calls to work."""
744,"""I took a plan which included four lines and unlimited talk and text and data for $350 a month,However when I got my first bill it was $1,250.00. I called to ask why but never recieved a straight answer! Stay away or you will loose all your money and most likely end up cussing some guy from India out !"""
23,"""I tried to get service through a store. After they entered all of the necessary information they got a message that the activation center was not available. I came home and entered all of the information again, then got the same message. I chatted online and then tried again, but got the same message. Then when I called Customer Care per chat instructions, I got the message to contact my service provider and a hang up. I tried this 5 times and got nowhere while chatting with an agent who would also not give me any help. Finally, I DEMANDED a supervisor after the agent, Darwin, would not give me an email address for Customer Care. I spent a total of two hours on the phone and an 8 hour day connecting to The Company. It finally works, but if this is how it begins, I prefer not to continue with them. Since I received calls from them, I asked that they not add that time to my 300 minutes limit, but the responded by telling me I should have called *86. They just don't get it. CUSTOMER SERVICE with The Company, is a disservice and not at all sensitive to customer concerns."""
291,"""I was a loyal customer to Another Company service since Another Company first came out. I think that was the best cell phone service I have ever had. There was responsible billing, great customer service, and my bill was actually something I look forward to. Now I get charged for """"Looking at the phone"""" before I even make a phone call. When I heard The Company was taking over Another Company I cringed because I knew that was the end of Good service. The service has gone to the dumps with The Company and I can't wait for my contract to end so that I can finally be one of the many who will make The Company bankrupt.

Phone said $55 month for unlimited data and internet, and 1,000 minutes a month. Monthly service was over $60 a month, Couldn't watch anything except youtube, 3g was spotty at best, phone froze twice and I had to call customer service to reboot it, both times losing all my contacts. Coverage area is a joke. Battery life, even with a battery saver app, was very short. The phone was so bad I purchased another phone with 3 weeks left on my Another Company service!!! Avoid this company at all costs!!!"""
195,"""I would never switch companies from The Company. I mean The Company goes above and beyond for there customers, They are really great with customer privacy, not just let people who just say they should access acount, because they use a phone access and ruin accounts, and they also dont cancel customers contracts, just because they call into customer service like another company. If you can give a REAL bad example of customer service, and not blame them because you dont pay attention to your bill, your contract that you sign or because they just wont give you credits for all of your overage charges, because you were not responsible enough to watch your minutes. Then please tell us all."""
670,"""I've been with The Company for almost six years now and am quite shocked to see all the negative reviews! In six years, I've only had to call them maybe a handful of times, but they were always helpful and able to resolve my issue quickly. I live in So Cal and I've never had an issue with my service and I travel back and forth to Vegas at least once a month! The only exception was once when traveling to South Carolina (the service was a little spotty in some places back there). I just purchased the Samsung Galaxy S3 and I love it! I've had the phone for about 3 months now and have had ZERO ISSUES with the phone or the service! I pay $50.00 a month ($45 for the service and $5 for the phone insurance) and am very happy with my service that I receive. I know a lot of other people who have The Company as well across the US and they love it as well, so I'm really at a loss to see this many people who are so angry with The Company."""
755,"""I've been with The Company for many years and have not only selected them as a carrier for my employer but also recommended them to many friends and family members because of their strong customer service. As a regional carrier, their coverage has never been the greatest and their phone offerings are behind the curve and sometimes really disappointing in quality, but their superior customer service was what kept me as a loyal customer. Until recently. It seems they are now spending a lot of money advertising about their happy customers and apparently a lot less money on actual customer service. Today when I had an issue, I was transferred several times, treated with alternating rudeness or apathy and no one cared to fix my issue. And, in fact, they never did fix it. Even when I asked to speak to a customer service supervisor. Bottom line? The only thing they really had going for them was their great customer service. Since they don't have that anymore, there is no reason to consider them. Not to say some local places may not still have good customer service - but as a caution, their phone support center is now right up there with the worst of the worst."""
783,"""I've been with The Company since they were Cell One, or basically 11 years. I've had friendly customer service, and good reception. I have maybe one dropped call every 2-3 years. I've had no real problems until I reduced my minutes at their recommendation, and proceded to go over my minutes by 650 minutes! I had no warning by them as to my minute usage, and they claimed absolutely no responsibility or leniency when I got a $400 bill.Â """

I went by Verison store and had to wait half an hour to get SIM installed. When I called customer to find out how to get pictures off old phone, was told by supervisor to take data card out. When I told her my phone did not have a data card she told me all phones had data card. When I asked her to tell me where it was in the Galaxy Nexus she then told me it did not have a data card I could remove. Went back to store where clerk told me to Bluetooth pictures to new phone but after several minutes of trying told me it would not work but she did not know why. She also told me it was all my fault for buying a phone without a removable data card even though a sales person at the store had directed me to the Nexus last July.

I even took my phone back to the store from which I purchased it and none of them could fix it. First, the touchscreen stopped responding. The music search was a joke. Then it automatically went into silent mode every time it went into sleep mode, and now it will neither send nor receive texts from anyone, except my phone itself. I am disgusted and frustrated with this sham of a company and would never recommend it to anyone. It truly is a waste of time and your hard-earned money."""
629,"""Short story is this, The Company only cares about your money. If they feel they are not getting enough of it they will find a way (any way) to bill you for more of it. Don't like it, tough.

We have three smart phones with data plans. I do find some surprising gaps in their coverage, frustratingly enough at my office in rural Geauga county. However, that is the exception mostly to a very positive experience. I can understand a lot of the complaints, but my suggestion is, go to one of their service centers and deal with real people first hand. And no, I don't own their stock or work for them."""

So the salesperson cancelled the and placed my order for a Samsung Galaxy Victory. Then I got an email saying the Entro was shipping. I assumed it was another mistake. It wasn't. The Entro arrived. Now that I had the Entro, I called to cancel the Galaxy Victory. Again, the horrible hold music and promos before the order was cancelled. A few days later the Galaxy Victory arrived. I called to find out how to return it. After talking to two agents (horrible hold music and promos twice), I was told I would have to pay to ship it back, then I could call yet again (more horrible hold music and promos) to request a refund on the postage.

Now first they told us just wait until March for one of the phones, June for the other, and the last needed to be in 2 years because it was the newest. Now, we weren't too happy but we dealt with it, come March they said oh no, its 2014, come June, oh no its July, and now we're just fed up and happily. We told them to send it in writing.

This was discovered only after I called and questioned why I was being charged almost double for my calls. And why I had been charged twice for my phone. The one stopped working after seven days (with no damgage done do it) and when I returned the phone for a new one, I was charged again on the bill. Despite the fact that the guy at the store said sometimes phones just stop working. I then recieved a call saying that since I was out of the service area (in MA) that my subscription would be terminated and I would be charged 150 dollars to do so. I called and spoke with someone out of the xx Customer Service Center and was told that I had no options other than to pay the 150 dollars or return my phone (not to be reimbursed and having to pay shipping costs).Â """

I do not see a need for those """"smart"""" phones since I have a nav system and a 10 disc sirus system in my vehicles, a PS3 at home, laptop and desktop computers at home and work just like everyone else. if you have to have a smart phone you are either a teenager or you are in dire need of a secretary."""
138,Go to all companies and see how different each one treats you. If they are pleasent its worth it. The Company is so much better and their customer service is a ten.
37,HATE HATE The Company MADE ME GOT THREW HELL HAD PROBLEMS WITH PIC MESSAGES AND RECIEVEING PIC MESSAGES AND LATER TURING ON MY CELL THEN I GOT MY HUSBANDS CONTACTS TO MY CELL AND HE GOT MINE I WILL NEVER GO BACK TO STUPID The Company EVER!!!!!!!
372,Horrible company to deal with. Defective phone arrived late. They wanted me to pay for returning a defective phone. You call them and wait hours for a live person. They then tell you they have to transfer you to a different department - they then disconnect you. You start all over again. Two hours later you are still nowhere. Ridiculous. I will never use them again. Ever. I would rather not have a cell phone than deal with them. They should be sued in a class action and have to pay millions of dollars. Even that would not be enough punishment for the hell they put me through.
489,I been with The Company since I bought my first android and the service has given me awsom coverage and its cheaper with the best monthly payment oppurtunities compare to other carriers and now I am using my 5th phone IPHONE 5 and The Company is the only carrier that has the cheapest monthly plan I have been really blessed by getting The Company ! love it..
204,I can't believe how unprofessional the staff is. My phone LCD (not the screen) cracked for some unknown reason. I went to get it replaced at the The Company store and they sent me to their repair center to get it replaced assuring me that they would have a replacement. I get to the The Company repair center and they stated that they do not carry the Galaxy S4 32GB and that I would have to call Phone Claim... I call phone claim and I order a replacement 32GB and they send me a 16GB Galaxy S4... I send it back and have to wait 6 days for it to get back to them... I wait the 6 days then call and they state that they received the phone and that the right version will be sent to me and arrive within 2 business days. It's been two business days and no phone... I call PhoneClaim and they stated that the phone has not been shipped... I ask why and they said it was not approved.. The lady on the phone sensed my stress and anger (I guess) and decided to speak to her manager and gets the phone shipped... (supposedly) we will see what happens... Service Sucks!!!
696,I can't say the rest of these reviews are real but I have been a no contract customer for over 5 years now and have not had any problems with the company or phones had sprint but couldn't afford them so I am glad to be out of their contract both myself and my son have the LG optimus elite and aside from normal battery issues will keep The Company mobile calls are not dropped sound is normal as any other phone um I would recommend them for many reasons
593,I have been a customer of this service for over 9 years and sometime in the last 2 years customer service and the quality of service has decreased greatly.
159,I have been using The Company for a little over a month. Love the value. $60/month for unlimited everything compared to my $120 with The Company. Call quality has been okay as I have had only 2 dropped calls in the time I have been with them and so far no major concerns with customer service. I get texts several days before reminding me to top up so I don't have service interruptions.
564,I have had service with The Company for almost two years. It's not the best but it is cheap. I finally upgraded my phone from the lg optimus to samsung galaxy. Really better phone all together. But know I'm trying to put service back on my old phone. And it's not taking. I have called tech support 5 times and received and ridicules excuse why its not working. Each tech has done exactly the same 5 steps the previous tech did. Didn't solve the problem. They document that I have had problems from the begining. Yet they can't solve the problem but they are great at passing the buck to another tech. So know I'm waiting 24-72 hours for a call back for that tech to reset the phone and still have the same problems. These phones are not complicated. There is only so much you can do before they realise it is the phone. I've told them it is the phone. Well know I have to clear my schedule for a phone call. Great!
81,I spent a couple hours on the phone with apple and at&t today about my boyfriend's lost phone. I kept getting comments from both ends about why one provider was better than the other. Apple put me on hold for a LONG time and the advice they gave me was something I had already done. Karen Johnson from The Company was awesome and patient and actually gave me good answers and advice.
669,Overall I am very satisfied with The Company. I had The Company for about 3 years and switched to another company because there was a better phone that I wanted. I stayed there until my contract ran out and switched back to The Company because the coverage and price was so much better. I've been here for about 4 years and don't anticipate switching. I do wish they would get a larger selection of phones.
581,Terrible!!!! I stayed up all night and was second in line to buy the iphone 5s. While I was about to purchase it the sales rep said that because my area code isn't local that he couldn't give me the upgrade discount. Are you freaking kidding me? I just upgraded 6 months ago at the same location. I even called the call center and they said there was nothing they can do. I was just in the store a few days ago too and they didn't tell me that. I don't have one good reason to stay with at&t. As soon as I can get the 5s with The Company then I am terminating my contract with at&t. Please stay far away from at&t!! Horrible customer service.
766,The company's billing is very high and when they charge extra their explanation is confusing and they never send the bill at home the customer service people seen to be answering from a script they dont do much to help their customers I think is because I am under a contract. I think I can find a company at a better cost and the same service some where else most of my friends pay less than I do.
12,The manager in this store is rude like hell.only if he sees a beautiful woman he's a dog right away give all she needs.I really feel that this man in this location is a dick just because I'm an older woman I need to wait and as soon someone younger get into the store he give all the time and she's finish first than me I 'm very disappointing.
111,They care about me as a customer. They treat me with respect and I can tell they want to keep me as a customer. They also have the best network in Chicago.
450,This company is great! I have the National 1000 plan and get national incoming calls any where in us along with national nights and weekends starting @7pm and where in us along with local m2m and only pay $79.99 for 3 phones on this plan. this gives me the freedom to use my phone while on travel and vacation! i also have a blackberry plan on my account. these prices have become cheaper since first coming out which is awesome! i have only had maybe one dropped call since i got there service maybe 2 tops. My internet is fast and i use it all the time while out of town or even shopping to look things up! battery swap is great i can swap my battery if mine is running slow at any us cell store! If i ever have any billing questions i call or stop into store and sales reps are always very friendly and nice helping me resolve any problems that i have. i have never had to have any of our phones sent out for warranty and they always last us at least till our contract is up sometimes even longer!
736,We have been customers for over 5 years and will not switch. We have no reason to. We can't seem to find a better deal or better service anywhere else.
493,i have been with Another Company since they came to baltimore. i love them i pay 60.00 a month for unlimited everything and my warantee i have had a problem only one time with my phone and thats because i dropped it but i went to my local corporate store and for 20.00 i recieved a brand new phone. the oonly thing i dont like is theyy dont have a phone upgrade you pay flat out the price of the phone. if they fix that and give a discount for phone up grades they would get a perfect 10
66,Â I've been with iCompany - Another Company for 4 years now. I have never had a problem - never dropped a call I have free roaming free long distance which is great for my family inutah west virginia etc. I even get roll over minutes. Every time I called customer service they have always helped me and even have a 24/7 late niht number there always on call - this is the best plan / company I have ever had I plan to stay with them. The only thing I dont like is there plans arnt cheap but you get great service
190,"""-Badest customer service -Poor reception -Lots of drop off calls -Bad phones (may be factory refurb sold as new) -Long wait time if you call customer service, many times call disconnect or representative will put on hold for not less 30 min. or (s)he will"""
549,"""After 2 and a half years with one of the big companies, it is such a pleasure to deal with The Company. There was no pressure at all in choosing a phone. In fact, when I looked at more expensive ones, the representative encouraged me to look at something less flashy because it met my needs better. I appreciated that. There have been a couple of small errors in billing but they were quick to correct and credit my account. What a change from my old company where they gave me incorrect information,over-charged me $600, argued with me and said they were just too busy to go over the bill with me. Sometimes I have to wait to get help. But there is someone there who welcomes me, takes my name, offers to get water or coffee and just makes me feel valued. The company has even invested in comfortable chairs for customers who have to wait. I love The Company."""

So far I had to called 25 times and go to the local store 4 times to get my money back. Most of the time they promised me I would receive the money in 24-48 hours. They acknowledged that they wrongfully took my money, but hesitated to return it. What a bunch of crooked thieves!"""
322,"""Buyer beware. You have no recourse with Another Company if you ever have any service problems. I have a new phone past the 30 days (5 months old).

I travel 100 miles + daily and rely on my phone for emergencies and in the event I have car problems on the road. I will receive a refurbished phone (someone else's problem phone) and no additional extension to the warranty. The CS reps were very nice but are not allowed to go outside Another Company rules regardless of the circumstances. Another Company is and has always been a very uncaring and unconcerned organization when it comes to customer satisfaction. Their overall ratings bare this statement out from other surveys, and they still make no effort to improve or to take care of long term customers that they have never had any problems with.

Remember, you have already PAID for service, THROUGH the 8th, but if they have a problem processing your payment on the 7th they will cut your service off and send you an automated text message letting you know. That's stealing as far as I'm concerned. Also, customer service routes you to India, where even the most basic concerns are either misinterpreted due to language barriers or willfully ignored due to policy. Hard to tell."""

I kept telling him he had the wrong address but he didn't get it, because when I called back the next day and spoke to an American they still had the wrong address. Finally i was able to clear it up and get started. The first installation guy was supposed to come inside to make sure everything was ready for service I was told to be home for specific hours and had to take off work. I thought the guy never showed so i called and apparently he was just checking the outside of the building and left. When i wasn't able to get a signal with a self install i called them back they sent me a dumb tech who couldn't figure out how to install it either. He said somebody would be coming the next day who could fix it. I asked when and he didn't know just said to wait for a call. Later the next day my neighbor tells me a guy from at&t was on the first floor of the apartment, (I have no buzzers working and specified i must be called to be let in) and i live on the third floor. My neighbor said he waited less than 2 minutes and left without calling me. I swiftly canceled the service and got almost all my money back. During the week i ordered i was suggested to sign up for a hotline u can call to help u self install but if i didn't cancel after a week i would be charged $10. This company is hired by at&t to help customers but even though i never had service i was charged and couldn't get my money back. I had to spend an hour on the phone just to get the company name number and cancel. My last nightmare happened when i returned the modem ups lost it and i was charged $150 it was taken straight out of my account since i was forced to sign a contract with auto something to do with my low credit rating. I called asked what happened they said its lost and they would call me back. They never did two weeks later i found the receipt with the tracking number so i called them back. They got the modem, and said they were sending a request for a full rebate. I get a call today and they sent me a check for $100. I was charged $150. So i had to send another request for my $50 check they are calling me friday to make sure it goes through.

495,"""I have been a The Company customer for a number of years, dating back to the other co days. The real problem with this company is a total lack of after-sales customer service: whether it be commercial or technical. It is extremely difficult (almost impossible) to obtain a knowledgeable agent to solve any problem. Generally the personnel are badly trained and badly informed. The real test of a company is not when everything is going well (as it should do!) but how they deal with a problem. The Company scores very, very low.

I will occasionally get messages a day after they were sent! This has cost me money. I have accumulated over 7000 rollover minutes. However, they are useless if I want to change my plan since I will lose them if I change plans. The customer service has been friendly on the 3-4 occasions that I have needed them. However, my calls to them were informational and not much was accomplished. The phones that I have received have functioned for the duration of the contract. On my last contract I had a Samsung phone where the screen went blank towards the end of the last contract. I waited until the end of the contract to get a new phone.

219,"""I honestly don't understand all the negative comments regarding Another Company. I have had them as a carrier now for several years. I came from The Company who had consistently messed up my bill and over charged me and screwed things up all the time. They only seemed to be about the almighty dollar no matter how they had to get it. Another Company on the other hand has been great!! I have personally found that they will go way above and beyond when it comes to customer service. I had previously owned an HTC Aria. It was a complete lemon of a phone. I went thru the rules and as a result had three different phones sent to me via the warranty. By the time I was ready for phone number four I said there is no way I will take a fourth Aria, obviously it's just a poorly made phone. At which point, I asked to exchange for a Samsung Galaxy and they approved. I was thrilled with that phone and hung on to it until recently upgrading to the Galaxy Note, my new all time favorite phone EVER. Any time I have ever had questions about my bill, phone anything, Another Company has always taken care of my questions or concerns immediately...many times giving me a nice credit on my bill without even asking. Out of all the cell companies I have been with, hands down Another Company has the best customer service. I truly believe they care about their customers and keeping them! They have found ways to lower my monthly bill as well. I have never had a rude or unwilling customer service rep. I highly recommend this company. As far as paying your bill, simply download their app and pay your bill right thru there. Doesn't cost anything. Also, when I have had tough financial months, they are more than willing to work with you, rather than like many companies who just merely shut you down. If you make a payment arrangement with them and stick to it, they will make arrangements with you anytime and never interrupt service. I would never change carriers for nothing! Oh, and as far as quality cell phone service/range....I've never had a dropped call or anything. Very clear, consistant service and phone calls. If ppl are posting all negative about Another Company, I really question their situation...and I promise, I do not work for Another Company, never have and am not paid in any way to post this. Just a very happy customer who have been with them about 9 yrs."""
735,"""I just changed my plan to unlimited minutes, which was very easy to do. However, be aware that they make the change retroactive so that it takes effect from your normal billing date.

Well, now at&t wanted to run my credit for the third time within one week. I was approved two times prior. I felt that didn't make any sense. The rep stated that if I allow them to run my credit again, I may receive a better promotion as a new customer. As far as I was concerned I was still a new customer, since I never intercepted the merchandise and it was returned to them unopened. I never received any service.

349,"""Just got my fifth phone since last July. They sent phone that said SIM card press-installed but was not. When turned new phone on turned old phone off. I had 3 phone and none would work. Called customer service because they had not sent tool to install SIM in new phone but they did not tell me I could use a paper clip. I went by Verison store and had to wait half an hour to get SIM installed. When I called customer to find out how to get pictures off old phone, was told by supervisor to take data card out. When I told her my phone did not have a data card she told me all phones had data card. When I asked her to tell me where it was in the Galaxy Nexus she then told me it did not have a data card I could remove. Went back to store where clerk told me to Bluetooth pictures to new phone but after several minutes of trying told me it would not work but she did not know why. She also told me it was all my fault for buying a phone without a removable data card even though a sales person at the store had directed me to the Nexus last July. To The Company the customer is always wrong!"""
532,"""My ZTE phone had problems from the beginning. It took 4 calls to get it activated properly. I've wasted countless minutes trying to get help from their ridiculous excuse for a technical support department, as well as the manufacturer. I even took my phone back to the store from which I purchased it and none of them could fix it. First, the touchscreen stopped responding. The music search was a joke. Then it automatically went into silent mode every time it went into sleep mode, and now it will neither send nor receive texts from anyone, except my phone itself. I am disgusted and frustrated with this sham of a company and would never recommend it to anyone. It truly is a waste of time and your hard-earned money."""

I'm just saying you can read all the reviews you want but the best thing to do is to try it for yourself. I personally love The Company and suggest it strongly to my friends. I went traveling to the east coast two years back and went all up and down the coast and had reception ALL the way. As well as it didn't charge me extra roaming fees. Personally I love it.

484,"""My fiance and i signed a 2-year agreement in December of 2011 with brand new phones. Our monthly bill was $180, which we soon changed to the share everything plan but they were still charging us $165; every month they would tell us we were going over in our data, but when we would check it ourselves on our phones or by going in to a store we were fine, but yet they would still charge us for it. Our phones didn't even last the year before they started dying out, but they wouldn't let us purchase new ones for anything less than $250. Then we moved to another town and couldn't even get service in our own home. So now that we've cancelled our service 8 months early, they are trying to charge us $450 PER PHONE!!! Our contract clearly states that they can charge us UP TO $350 PER ACCOUNT, definitely not $450 and definitely not per phone. Signing a contract with The Company was nothing but a constant hassle and rip-off. I wouldn't recommend them to anyone."""

Most recently I got on and had the cheeriest, friendliest and genuinely eager person to help me with a billing issue (I was concerned about how much I'd be billed for accepting collect calls) She helped me, and it turned out I was billed nothing extra, But during our conversation when I mentioned I might have to lealve Another Company because I couldn't afford my plan (they do need to work on more affordable plans) she offered me a 40$ credit because of my loyalty thus far.

The one stopped working after seven days (with no damgage done do it) and when I returned the phone for a new one, I was charged again on the bill.

30,Horrible company to deal with. Defective phone arrived late. They wanted me to pay for returning a defective phone. You call them and wait hours for a live person. They then tell you they have to transfer you to a different department - they then disconnect you. You start all over again. Two hours later you are still nowhere. Ridiculous. I will never use them again. Ever. I would rather not have a cell phone than deal with them. They should be sued in a class action and have to pay millions of dollars. Even that would not be enough punishment for the hell they put me through.
107,I been with The Company since I bought my first android and the service has given me awsom coverage and its cheaper with the best monthly payment oppurtunities compare to other carriers and now I am using my 5th phone IPHONE 5 and The Company is the only carrier that has the cheapest monthly plan I have been really blessed by getting The Company ! love it..
79,I can't believe how unprofessional the staff is. My phone LCD (not the screen) cracked for some unknown reason. I went to get it replaced at the The Company store and they sent me to their repair center to get it replaced assuring me that they would have a replacement. I get to the The Company repair center and they stated that they do not carry the Galaxy S4 32GB and that I would have to call Phone Claim... I call phone claim and I order a replacement 32GB and they send me a 16GB Galaxy S4... I send it back and have to wait 6 days for it to get back to them... I wait the 6 days then call and they state that they received the phone and that the right version will be sent to me and arrive within 2 business days. It's been two business days and no phone... I call PhoneClaim and they stated that the phone has not been shipped... I ask why and they said it was not approved.. The lady on the phone sensed my stress and anger (I guess) and decided to speak to her manager and gets the phone shipped... (supposedly) we will see what happens... Service Sucks!!!
507,I can't say the rest of these reviews are real but I have been a no contract customer for over 5 years now and have not had any problems with the company or phones had sprint but couldn't afford them so I am glad to be out of their contract both myself and my son have the LG optimus elite and aside from normal battery issues will keep The Company mobile calls are not dropped sound is normal as any other phone um I would recommend them for many reasons
506,I have been a customer of this service for over 9 years and sometime in the last 2 years customer service and the quality of service has decreased greatly.
212,I have been using The Company for a little over a month. Love the value. $60/month for unlimited everything compared to my $120 with The Company. Call quality has been okay as I have had only 2 dropped calls in the time I have been with them and so far no major concerns with customer service. I get texts several days before reminding me to top up so I don't have service interruptions.
384,I have had service with The Company for almost two years. It's not the best but it is cheap. I finally upgraded my phone from the lg optimus to samsung galaxy. Really better phone all together. But know I'm trying to put service back on my old phone. And it's not taking. I have called tech support 5 times and received and ridicules excuse why its not working. Each tech has done exactly the same 5 steps the previous tech did. Didn't solve the problem. They document that I have had problems from the begining. Yet they can't solve the problem but they are great at passing the buck to another tech. So know I'm waiting 24-72 hours for a call back for that tech to reset the phone and still have the same problems. These phones are not complicated. There is only so much you can do before they realise it is the phone. I've told them it is the phone. Well know I have to clear my schedule for a phone call. Great!
306,I spent a couple hours on the phone with apple and at&t today about my boyfriend's lost phone. I kept getting comments from both ends about why one provider was better than the other. Apple put me on hold for a LONG time and the advice they gave me was something I had already done. Karen Johnson from The Company was awesome and patient and actually gave me good answers and advice.
102,Overall I am very satisfied with The Company. I had The Company for about 3 years and switched to another company because there was a better phone that I wanted. I stayed there until my contract ran out and switched back to The Company because the coverage and price was so much better. I've been here for about 4 years and don't anticipate switching. I do wish they would get a larger selection of phones.
214,Terrible!!!! I stayed up all night and was second in line to buy the iphone 5s. While I was about to purchase it the sales rep said that because my area code isn't local that he couldn't give me the upgrade discount. Are you freaking kidding me? I just upgraded 6 months ago at the same location. I even called the call center and they said there was nothing they can do. I was just in the store a few days ago too and they didn't tell me that. I don't have one good reason to stay with at&t. As soon as I can get the 5s with The Company then I am terminating my contract with at&t. Please stay far away from at&t!! Horrible customer service.
683,The company's billing is very high and when they charge extra their explanation is confusing and they never send the bill at home the customer service people seen to be answering from a script they dont do much to help their customers I think is because I am under a contract. I think I can find a company at a better cost and the same service some where else most of my friends pay less than I do.
542,The manager in this store is rude like hell.only if he sees a beautiful woman he's a dog right away give all she needs.I really feel that this man in this location is a dick just because I'm an older woman I need to wait and as soon someone younger get into the store he give all the time and she's finish first than me I 'm very disappointing.
135,They care about me as a customer. They treat me with respect and I can tell they want to keep me as a customer. They also have the best network in Chicago.
264,This company is great! I have the National 1000 plan and get national incoming calls any where in us along with national nights and weekends starting @7pm and where in us along with local m2m and only pay $79.99 for 3 phones on this plan. this gives me the freedom to use my phone while on travel and vacation! i also have a blackberry plan on my account. these prices have become cheaper since first coming out which is awesome! i have only had maybe one dropped call since i got there service maybe 2 tops. My internet is fast and i use it all the time while out of town or even shopping to look things up! battery swap is great i can swap my battery if mine is running slow at any us cell store! If i ever have any billing questions i call or stop into store and sales reps are always very friendly and nice helping me resolve any problems that i have. i have never had to have any of our phones sent out for warranty and they always last us at least till our contract is up sometimes even longer!
73,We have been customers for over 5 years and will not switch. We have no reason to. We can't seem to find a better deal or better service anywhere else.
465,i have been with Another Company since they came to baltimore. i love them i pay 60.00 a month for unlimited everything and my warantee i have had a problem only one time with my phone and thats because i dropped it but i went to my local corporate store and for 20.00 i recieved a brand new phone. the oonly thing i dont like is theyy dont have a phone upgrade you pay flat out the price of the phone. if they fix that and give a discount for phone up grades they would get a perfect 10
536,Â I've been with iCompany - Another Company for 4 years now. I have never had a problem - never dropped a call I have free roaming free long distance which is great for my family inutah west virginia etc. I even get roll over minutes. Every time I called customer service they have always helped me and even have a 24/7 late niht number there always on call - this is the best plan / company I have ever had I plan to stay with them. The only thing I dont like is there plans arnt cheap but you get great service

516,"""After 2 and a half years with one of the big companies, it is such a pleasure to deal with The Company. There was no pressure at all in choosing a phone. In fact, when I looked at more expensive ones, the representative encouraged me to look at something less flashy because it met my needs better. I appreciated that. There have been a couple of small errors in billing but they were quick to correct and credit my account. What a change from my old company where they gave me incorrect information,over-charged me $600, argued with me and said they were just too busy to go over the bill with me. Sometimes I have to wait to get help. But there is someone there who welcomes me, takes my name, offers to get water or coffee and just makes me feel valued. The company has even invested in comfortable chairs for customers who have to wait. I love The Company."""
741,"""BAD SERVICE! poor customer service! Not at all willing to listen and resolve issues. Sarcastic, nasty and should be drummed out of the business!

157,"""Beware of The Company. It's no more than a bunch of thieves. It took money from my credit card in Nov. When I complained, they told me the money will be applied back to my credit card within 24-48 hours, which did not happen. So far I had to called 25 times and go to the local store 4 times to get my money back. Most of the time they promised me I would receive the money in 24-48 hours. They acknowledged that they wrongfully took my money, but hesitated to return it. What a bunch of crooked thieves!"""
390,"""Buyer beware. You have no recourse with Another Company if you ever have any service problems. I have a new phone past the 30 days (5 months old). I am told I will have to wait a minimum of 5 business days to get a replacement phone during which time I will be totally without service. I travel 100 miles + daily and rely on my phone for emergencies and in the event I have car problems on the road. I will receive a refurbished phone (someone else's problem phone) and no additional extension to the warranty. The CS reps were very nice but are not allowed to go outside Another Company rules regardless of the circumstances. Another Company is and has always been a very uncaring and unconcerned organization when it comes to customer satisfaction. Their overall ratings bare this statement out from other surveys, and they still make no effort to improve or to take care of long term customers that they have never had any problems with. What does this tell you about Another Company? Draw your own conclusion."""

The data only works half the time, the other half of the time it will endlessly load but never successfully access a webpage. If you have a new period of service beginning on the 9th and you have an automatic payment method on file, they will start trying to bill you on the 7th. Remember, you have already PAID for service, THROUGH the 8th, but if they have a problem processing your payment on the 7th they will cut your service off and send you an automated text message letting you know. That's stealing as far as I'm concerned. Also, customer service routes you to India, where even the most basic concerns are either misinterpreted due to language barriers or willfully ignored due to policy. Hard to tell."""

316,"""First the Indian guy on the phone has the wrong address and keeps telling me i already have an account with U-verse before i even signed up. I kept telling him he had the wrong address but he didn't get it, because when I called back the next day and spoke to an American they still had the wrong address. Finally i was able to clear it up and get started. The first installation guy was supposed to come inside to make sure everything was ready for service I was told to be home for specific hours and had to take off work. I thought the guy never showed so i called and apparently he was just checking the outside of the building and left. When i wasn't able to get a signal with a self install i called them back they sent me a dumb tech who couldn't figure out how to install it either. He said somebody would be coming the next day who could fix it. I asked when and he didn't know just said to wait for a call. Later the next day my neighbor tells me a guy from at&t was on the first floor of the apartment, (I have no buzzers working and specified i must be called to be let in) and i live on the third floor. My neighbor said he waited less than 2 minutes and left without calling me. I swiftly canceled the service and got almost all my money back. During the week i ordered i was suggested to sign up for a hotline u can call to help u self install but if i didn't cancel after a week i would be charged $10. This company is hired by at&t to help customers but even though i never had service i was charged and couldn't get my money back. I had to spend an hour on the phone just to get the company name number and cancel. My last nightmare happened when i returned the modem ups lost it and i was charged $150 it was taken straight out of my account since i was forced to sign a contract with auto something to do with my low credit rating. I called asked what happened they said its lost and they would call me back. They never did two weeks later i found the receipt with the tracking number so i called them back. They got the modem, and said they were sending a request for a full rebate. I get a call today and they sent me a check for $100. I was charged $150. So i had to send another request for my $50 check they are calling me friday to make sure it goes through. Worst experience of my life called xfinity they were there in two days installed in 1 and a half hours and havent had any problems"""

491,"""Great customer service!!! Even though we didn't report it stolen right away (we thought he must've misplaced it...he is a 12 yo kid), they refunded every penny the other kid charged up! They sat with me on the phone for over 2 hours, going over it line by line and crediting back for every 3rd party purchase/download. It was a lot of time I didn't really have, but the lady, Lisa Goss, was absolutely amazing...patient and very, very nice. I was mad...you can't imagine how mad...and she was just great. Their customer service is usually really good anyway though. I think that is why we stick with them even with the other stuff. You just can't find good customer service anymore.Â """
787,"""Great value, least expensive carrier in Central Oregon. Terrific service, no dropped calls, other family members are contracted with The Company, The Company and The Company.

Today was a special day, I met Debbie, employee # 100583047, her effervescent personality hung in there helping me for about an hour. At least 6 others in the past 2 weeks could not accomplish this. Debbie succeeded when all others failed, she was able to increase the number of rings I hear before it goes to voicemail."""

Most of the time I do not get tower in my home. They could not support web for my mobile. Also, most of SMS what comes from outside like bank or facebook sms do not reach me. It ultimate waste of money. Also, their customer care behave very rudely, when I went for any issue."""
246,"""I been with the company 6 yrs and always had good service.Don't have a fancy phone,just a flip top cheapie.What few times I did call them,I got an english speaking person who did fix my problem,or change phones that is.I did have a problem awhile back tho.They cancelled one of my 2 phones because they said something about not being able to get the payment.So they cancelled the phone without notice,I was miffed.But called and they put me back on the same plan grandfathered in 6 yrs ago which is $5.00 a month and I get $5.00 worth of minutes,so basically it's free.I had $257.00 worth of minutes saved.They didn't give me all that back.but did give $50.00 and with the $15.00 for 3 months,gave me $65.00 to start it off.So I'm happy.I think their a great outfit for a light user like me.Obviously we don't ever use them hardly.Just for emergency,or an occasional question to home from the store.So,I would recomend them.And DO check your coverage area on their site to see if your in a coverage area.My area just has phone and data only."""
270,"""I don't have a problem with dropped calls but the network 3G is horrible. I lose my 3G connection constantly. And 4G it doesn't exist, no matter what they try to tell you. Everything I put into the search engine comes up with a network error message. I've had this phone over a year now and have called customer service at least 6-7 times. Their service is run out of India and the technicians are difficult to understand. When problems are FINALLY resolved, there's a new problem a few weeks later. Don't waste your time or money. There are other providers without contracts and much better coverage. If you only need a phone to make calls, good deal."""

When I called them, they told me I needed to call my bank and tell them I didn't authorize the transaction!!! WTH!!! I wasn't satisfied with that answer so I called back, the next person said they have to open a case and it could take 3-4 weeks for me to get a refund, I wasn't satisfied with that either, I called again to get a different person and this rep. told me it would be 7 days before I get refunded...

Then when I asked about the month of service that I paid for, they told me I would lose it, unless I buy a new phone from them."""
65,"""I have been a The Company customer for a number of years, dating back to the other co days. The real problem with this company is a total lack of after-sales customer service: whether it be commercial or technical. It is extremely difficult (almost impossible) to obtain a knowledgeable agent to solve any problem. Generally the personnel are badly trained and badly informed. The real test of a company is not when everything is going well (as it should do!) but how they deal with a problem. The Company scores very, very low. In summary the service is ok as long as it works, but as soon as you have a problem you can not count on them for help. There are many other better phone companies to choose from!"""
571,"""We've had The Company for several years and added our kids phones on the family plan just last year. Free nights (after 7 p.m.) and weekends are great. Plus, they just turned on a new tower about six blocks from our home and service on calls is incredible."""
340,"""We've had The Company for years in southeastern NC. Our experience is 100% positive. The only bad thing I could say is sometimes the place is so crowded we have to wait, but they keep training more agents, who are friendly and helpful. They suggest ways we could save money--ask about their """"Partners"""" program. If your employer uses USC you can get a discount on your personal account. The repair department has helped me out several times."""
371,"""I have been a customer of The Company for 8 years now. For $100 a month including taxes I have a family plan that includes two lines and 1000 minutes a month. I do not text or use the internet. The service has been o.k. for the most part. I get reception almost everywhere in NYC but I sometimes lose calls in parts of stores. The voice mail has recently become a problem. I will occasionally get messages a day after they were sent! This has cost me money. I have accumulated over 7000 rollover minutes. However, they are useless if I want to change my plan since I will lose them if I change plans. The customer service has been friendly on the 3-4 occasions that I have needed them. However, my calls to them were informational and not much was accomplished. The phones that I have received have functioned for the duration of the contract. On my last contract I had a Samsung phone where the screen went blank towards the end of the last contract. I waited until the end of the contract to get a new phone. For the money that I am paying, I should be getting internet service included. I am planning to switch to another carrier!"""

Now that I am starting to count pennies a little more I realize that I have been paying for cream of the crop phone service for a long time.

388,"""I have had The Company since October, 2002 and was off at college in the boonies.

308,"""I have tried out company x, another company, The Company, and The Company and i can absolutely say The Company is the worst carrier I have ever had. The service is nothing short of terrible, I live in the city and barely get one bar at times, and when i do miraculously have full bars it is still slower than molasses. On top of the horrible service, my phone would send out the same text up to six times, and sometimes i would send / receive texts the next day!! For your own sanity do not use The Company"""
702,"""I honestly don't understand all the negative comments regarding Another Company. I have had them as a carrier now for several years. I came from The Company who had consistently messed up my bill and over charged me and screwed things up all the time. They only seemed to be about the almighty dollar no matter how they had to get it. Another Company on the other hand has been great!! I have personally found that they will go way above and beyond when it comes to customer service. I had previously owned an HTC Aria. It was a complete lemon of a phone. I went thru the rules and as a result had three different phones sent to me via the warranty. By the time I was ready for phone number four I said there is no way I will take a fourth Aria, obviously it's just a poorly made phone. At which point, I asked to exchange for a Samsung Galaxy and they approved. I was thrilled with that phone and hung on to it until recently upgrading to the Galaxy Note, my new all time favorite phone EVER. Any time I have ever had questions about my bill, phone anything, Another Company has always taken care of my questions or concerns immediately...many times giving me a nice credit on my bill without even asking. Out of all the cell companies I have been with, hands down Another Company has the best customer service. I truly believe they care about their customers and keeping them! They have found ways to lower my monthly bill as well. I have never had a rude or unwilling customer service rep. I highly recommend this company. As far as paying your bill, simply download their app and pay your bill right thru there. Doesn't cost anything. Also, when I have had tough financial months, they are more than willing to work with you, rather than like many companies who just merely shut you down. If you make a payment arrangement with them and stick to it, they will make arrangements with you anytime and never interrupt service. I would never change carriers for nothing! Oh, and as far as quality cell phone service/range....I've never had a dropped call or anything. Very clear, consistant service and phone calls. If ppl are posting all negative about Another Company, I really question their situation...and I promise, I do not work for Another Company, never have and am not paid in any way to post this. Just a very happy customer who have been with them about 9 yrs."""
286,"""I just changed my plan to unlimited minutes, which was very easy to do. However, be aware that they make the change retroactive so that it takes effect from your normal billing date. For me this means that even though my billing cycle is half done they are billing me at the new unlimited rate for the entire billing cycle. In other words, I am paying for two weeks of a service which I never used. This is unfair and I would like to see The Company prorate these charges so that we pay for what we get."""
176,"""I ordered new service and was given different promotional information by three different representatives. When I realized that the plan I recently ordered five days prior did not offer me the complete promotional details for my area, I cancelled it. I then placed another order with the better promotion. That same day I received an email stating the order I had just placed was cancelled due to dual orders placed. I called to conflict issue and place yet another order. Well, now at&t wanted to run my credit for the third time within one week. I was approved two times prior. I felt that didn't make any sense. The rep stated that if I allow them to run my credit again, I may receive a better promotion as a new customer. As far as I was concerned I was still a new customer, since I never intercepted the merchandise and it was returned to them unopened. I never received any service. That was a true indicator of the customer service I would receive if I were to continue to proceed to receive the service.... The Company sucked ten years ago when they took ameritech and they STILL SUCK. NOT ABOUT THE CUSTOMER."""
587,"""I spent hours, days; weeks trying to get customer service, via phone and email, to little avail. I could NOT use my phone IN MY home, other than at the kitchen window, and even that was not dependable.

I am back to The Company, where I never had dropped calls. I now know why I pay a little more. Lesson learned!"" I purchased a The Company phone that turned out to be defective. Getting a replacement phone has been near to impossible - after having contacted the company and spent literally hours and hours and days and days on the phone waiting and talking to people who either could not or simply did not do what they said they would. I am still waiting to get this processed after TWO weeks of phone calls and waits and promises by 'supervisors' - they have lied and literally done nothing. They are terrible and I warn all to shop elsewhere - save yourself!!

Actually, I don't feel that sorry for them. The company just cut my service off for no reason and now I've been sitting on the phone with them for fifteen minutes while this guy tries to figure out why. I also had to file a dispute form through my bank last month because the company had overcharged me $50 and magically could not find any record of it. That issue still has not been resolved. I could let fifty bucks slide but now it is a matter of principle. I'm pissed. Is the savings worth this crap?"" ""I bought the new HTC EVO 5 because it seemed like a good deal and the service price was a little cheaper than my T Mobile plan-big mistake,my internet and text messaging did not work after 3 days.

632,"""I think if you're not sure which carrier to go with, ask people who live in your area. The most important to ongoing satisfaction: """"do you get reception? and do the calls drop?"""" Having more minutes and a cooler phone won't count if you can't get calls to work."""

I tried this 5 times and got nowhere while chatting with an agent who would also not give me any help. Finally, I DEMANDED a supervisor after the agent, Darwin, would not give me an email address for Customer Care. I spent a total of two hours on the phone and an 8 hour day connecting to The Company. It finally works, but if this is how it begins, I prefer not to continue with them. Since I received calls from them, I asked that they not add that time to my 300 minutes limit, but the responded by telling me I should have called *86. They just don't get it.

If you can give a REAL bad example of customer service, and not blame them because you dont pay attention to your bill, your contract that you sign or because they just wont give you credits for all of your overage charges, because you were not responsible enough to watch your minutes.

I live in So Cal and I've never had an issue with my service and I travel back and forth to Vegas at least once a month! The only exception was once when traveling to South Carolina (the service was a little spotty in some places back there). I just purchased the Samsung Galaxy S3 and I love it! I've had the phone for about 3 months now and have had ZERO ISSUES with the phone or the service! I pay $50.00 a month ($45 for the service and $5 for the phone insurance) and am very happy with my service that I receive.

As a regional carrier, their coverage has never been the greatest and their phone offerings are behind the curve and sometimes really disappointing in quality, but their superior customer service was what kept me as a loyal customer. Until recently. It seems they are now spending a lot of money advertising about their happy customers and apparently a lot less money on actual customer service. Today when I had an issue, I was transferred several times, treated with alternating rudeness or apathy and no one cared to fix my issue. And, in fact, they never did fix it. Even when I asked to speak to a customer service supervisor. Bottom line? The only thing they really had going for them was their great customer service. Since they don't have that anymore, there is no reason to consider them. Not to say some local places may not still have good customer service - but as a caution, their phone support center is now right up there with the worst of the worst."""

I went by Verison store and had to wait half an hour to get SIM installed. When I called customer to find out how to get pictures off old phone, was told by supervisor to take data card out. When I told her my phone did not have a data card she told me all phones had data card. When I asked her to tell me where it was in the Galaxy Nexus she then told me it did not have a data card I could remove. Went back to store where clerk told me to Bluetooth pictures to new phone but after several minutes of trying told me it would not work but she did not know why.

Then it automatically went into silent mode every time it went into sleep mode, and now it will neither send nor receive texts from anyone, except my phone itself.

Our phones didn't even last the year before they started dying out, but they wouldn't let us purchase new ones for anything less than $250. Then we moved to another town and couldn't even get service in our own home. So now that we've cancelled our service 8 months early, they are trying to charge us $450 PER PHONE!!! Our contract clearly states that they can charge us UP TO $350 PER ACCOUNT, definitely not $450 and definitely not per phone.

Do not go for this company! It's terrible. Bad costumer service. Bad cell reception. They charge you for 3G, even when you don't use it. They are overpriced, you can definitely find a better cell company for less money and better quality. Pass it on."""

Most recently I got on and had the cheeriest, friendliest and genuinely eager person to help me with a billing issue (I was concerned about how much I'd be billed for accepting collect calls) She helped me, and it turned out I was billed nothing extra, But during our conversation when I mentioned I might have to lealve Another Company because I couldn't afford my plan (they do need to work on more affordable plans) she offered me a 40$ credit because of my loyalty thus far.

687,"""Short story is this, The Company only cares about your money. If they feel they are not getting enough of it they will find a way (any way) to bill you for more of it. Don't like it, tough. It was cheaper to pay the $150 to get out of my The Company """"mafia"""" contract and go The Company, although, I now have to watch my back as I'm told that they have a contract out on me for doing this. The Company has a legal license to steal your money and there is NOTHING you can do about it."""
764,"""Summary: I have never had a problem with at&t when it comes down to my cell phone carrier. Ive been with them for 10 years now, and have had nothing but good things to say for them. I love theyre phones, and theyre customer service is as friendly as can be. theyre so helpful!"""
31,"""The Company isn't a major phone company yet, so this means that a person who moves to a location where The Company or other big phone companies are, The Company might not be, making the user switch over to a different service. Though the company is great in more remote places that other companies, being consolidated into certain areas makes it hard for a person who moves constantly to stay with the company very long."""
773,"""The Company sold me a phone with 4G. There is a huge banner in the store saying 'blazing fast 4G network!'. When I got it home I found out that I lived and the store that sold me the phone was in fact in a """"blazing"""" 2G network. Phone worked as well as a flip phone but thats it. Took it back. Bad p.r. The Company."""
417,"""The coverage all over NC is great. I used to work in town x where my co-workers had The Company and The Company, which had local towers. Our office was on an interior hallway where neither of their phones would ring. Despite USC having to use another company's towers, people would call me to reach them."""
444,"""The reason i have go with Another Company is b/c my credit ant that good to go with companys like xxx i try these company the all want big deposit down but so far i haven't had any problems with Another Company services or phones i been with then sences 2009 at lest i don't have a contact to sign with Another Company the other companys you do at lest 1 or 2 yrs contract with the other company and they do charge you high price for mins that u use at lest you don't have pay high price for unlimited calls that u make and price are good to me what i can afford in my budget if i went with any different company i would be paying high price for the services and for the phone and to rent the phone as well so to me i think Another Company is good special people who can't afford lot to spend out on phones and services"""
518,"""Their customer service is really bad and their rule on stopping service is very unreasonable. My billing cycle goes from 19th of each month to 18th of the next month. I stopped my service on the 2nd of the month. Then, they still charge me the whole billing cycle although I did not use their service from the 2nd to the 18th. It totally does not make sense at all. When I stopped my service with Tmobile, Tmobile reasonably reimbursed my unused cost (prorated). Does anybody else has such experience similar to mine?"""
414,"""This company is no good. I've been with this company for 10 years and I'm done.. Well I was done about 4 years ago and still haven't changed, just need to vent. I just really, really, REALLY despise this company and their team of robot customer service people. ahhh!!"""
362,"""Well if you enjoy not getting the call's you need or getting text messages three days later, this is the plan for you! If you really love paying more for less this is exactly what you'll get. And best of all if you get your jollies by spending all day on hold waiting to talk to a grouchy customer service representative who can't help you anyways, look no further! Seriously I could go on all day, but to make it short: Worst customer service known to mankind Horrible Coverage Phones are a piece and constantly having issues Most expensive and for no reason! Doesn't make sense to pay more, for less! less coverage, less data and less customer service. If there was a way to mark them a .5 I would have!"""
522,"""What a nightmare! So many errors necessitating so many calls, each with its long hold times and nightmare music clips and promos. I bought a Samsung Entro on the VM website, receiving email confirmation, then an email telling me there was a problem processing the order and I needed to call. After listening to horrible hold music and promos) I was told the phone was on backorder and wouldn't be available for at least 6 months. So the salesperson cancelled the and placed my order for a Samsung Galaxy Victory. Then I got an email saying the Entro was shipping. I assumed it was another mistake. It wasn't. The Entro arrived. Now that I had the Entro, I called to cancel the Galaxy Victory. Again, the horrible hold music and promos before the order was cancelled. A few days later the Galaxy Victory arrived. I called to find out how to return it. After talking to two agents (horrible hold music and promos twice), I was told I would have to pay to ship it back, then I could call yet again (more horrible hold music and promos) to request a refund on the postage. I couldn't take anymore. I was quite rude to the agent and hung up on her. The service is good (and cheap) but don't buy your phones from The Company!"""
530,"""When we were still happy with it, it was when they were giving us good service. However about a year ago, we decided we wanted to quit because they'd changed somethings and wouldn't give us the unlimited internet we'd had and whatnot, which you could say was partially our fault for cancelling it but when we called a week later they told us too bad, but the bill was getting to so as I said we wanted to quit. Now first they told us just wait until March for one of the phones, June for the other, and the last needed to be in 2 years because it was the newest. Now, we weren't too happy but we dealt with it, come March they said oh no, its 2014, come June, oh no its July, and now we're just fed up and happily. We told them to send it in writing. Come July, my family was spitting fire because they were trying to get us to stay and trying to feed us a bunch of B.S. I recommend to stay away from The Company"""
147,"""Worst experience of any cell phone company. Out and out lied to me that the phone I was buying had web service and then sold me a plan for web service. I was promised that they could port my old number ....WRONG. I was promised a 30 day money back guarantee, WRONG. I am now out for the cost of the phone AND data plan and haven't even used the phone once. oh, and now have shipping charges to send it back. No offense to the people of Malaysia which is where the call center is I believe....couldn't understand a single word of one person and kept calling back until I found someone I could understand.Â """
126,"""been with them for 10 years. They are great! I had one problem with their connectivity quality and it was resolved loading a new PPL. I have an inexpensive plan, get coverage all over the USA, while people are spending 100s my bill is about $58, $6 of that is text messaging which I don't use all the much and $7 in taxes. They always answer the phone and solve my problem. NOT looking forward to being forced to go to The Company."""
730,"""Â After my plan ran up, I renewed my plan, but before doing so I told them that I would be moving to live in MA permanetly. I asked if I would get service and was told I would. However, after the 30 trial period was up, I was given a call telling me that I was not in a proper service area (though I had a nation wide plan). This was discovered only after I called and questioned why I was being charged almost double for my calls. And why I had been charged twice for my phone. The one stopped working after seven days (with no damgage done do it) and when I returned the phone for a new one, I was charged again on the bill. Despite the fact that the guy at the store said sometimes phones just stop working. I then recieved a call saying that since I was out of the service area (in MA) that my subscription would be terminated and I would be charged 150 dollars to do so. I called and spoke with someone out of the xx Customer Service Center and was told that I had no options other than to pay the 150 dollars or return my phone (not to be reimbursed and having to pay shipping costs).Â """
492,"""Â I was originally with a big company starting in 1995 and did not switch when The Company took over due to the fact that my contract would be grandfathered in. I have been more than happy with their service and prices. I have no incoming charges, nights for me stayed the same from Primeco free after 7pm, 1000 prime min. free. Free incoming texts. I do not see a need for those """"smart"""" phones since I have a nav system and a 10 disc sirus system in my vehicles, a PS3 at home, laptop and desktop computers at home and work just like everyone else. if you have to have a smart phone you are either a teenager or you are in dire need of a secretary."""
379,Go to all companies and see how different each one treats you. If they are pleasent its worth it. The Company is so much better and their customer service is a ten.
339,HATE HATE The Company MADE ME GOT THREW HELL HAD PROBLEMS WITH PIC MESSAGES AND RECIEVEING PIC MESSAGES AND LATER TURING ON MY CELL THEN I GOT MY HUSBANDS CONTACTS TO MY CELL AND HE GOT MINE I WILL NEVER GO BACK TO STUPID The Company EVER!!!!!!!
237,Horrible company to deal with. Defective phone arrived late. They wanted me to pay for returning a defective phone. You call them and wait hours for a live person. They then tell you they have to transfer you to a different department - they then disconnect you. You start all over again. Two hours later you are still nowhere. Ridiculous. I will never use them again. Ever. I would rather not have a cell phone than deal with them. They should be sued in a class action and have to pay millions of dollars. Even that would not be enough punishment for the hell they put me through.
359,I been with The Company since I bought my first android and the service has given me awsom coverage and its cheaper with the best monthly payment oppurtunities compare to other carriers and now I am using my 5th phone IPHONE 5 and The Company is the only carrier that has the cheapest monthly plan I have been really blessed by getting The Company ! love it..
228,I can't believe how unprofessional the staff is. My phone LCD (not the screen) cracked for some unknown reason. I went to get it replaced at the The Company store and they sent me to their repair center to get it replaced assuring me that they would have a replacement. I get to the The Company repair center and they stated that they do not carry the Galaxy S4 32GB and that I would have to call Phone Claim... I call phone claim and I order a replacement 32GB and they send me a 16GB Galaxy S4... I send it back and have to wait 6 days for it to get back to them... I wait the 6 days then call and they state that they received the phone and that the right version will be sent to me and arrive within 2 business days. It's been two business days and no phone... I call PhoneClaim and they stated that the phone has not been shipped... I ask why and they said it was not approved.. The lady on the phone sensed my stress and anger (I guess) and decided to speak to her manager and gets the phone shipped... (supposedly) we will see what happens... Service Sucks!!!
169,I can't say the rest of these reviews are real but I have been a no contract customer for over 5 years now and have not had any problems with the company or phones had sprint but couldn't afford them so I am glad to be out of their contract both myself and my son have the LG optimus elite and aside from normal battery issues will keep The Company mobile calls are not dropped sound is normal as any other phone um I would recommend them for many reasons
520,I have been a customer of this service for over 9 years and sometime in the last 2 years customer service and the quality of service has decreased greatly.
691,I have been using The Company for a little over a month. Love the value. $60/month for unlimited everything compared to my $120 with The Company. Call quality has been okay as I have had only 2 dropped calls in the time I have been with them and so far no major concerns with customer service. I get texts several days before reminding me to top up so I don't have service interruptions.
3,I have had service with The Company for almost two years. It's not the best but it is cheap. I finally upgraded my phone from the lg optimus to samsung galaxy. Really better phone all together. But know I'm trying to put service back on my old phone. And it's not taking. I have called tech support 5 times and received and ridicules excuse why its not working. Each tech has done exactly the same 5 steps the previous tech did. Didn't solve the problem. They document that I have had problems from the begining. Yet they can't solve the problem but they are great at passing the buck to another tech. So know I'm waiting 24-72 hours for a call back for that tech to reset the phone and still have the same problems. These phones are not complicated. There is only so much you can do before they realise it is the phone. I've told them it is the phone. Well know I have to clear my schedule for a phone call. Great!
770,I spent a couple hours on the phone with apple and at&t today about my boyfriend's lost phone. I kept getting comments from both ends about why one provider was better than the other. Apple put me on hold for a LONG time and the advice they gave me was something I had already done. Karen Johnson from The Company was awesome and patient and actually gave me good answers and advice.
29,Overall I am very satisfied with The Company. I had The Company for about 3 years and switched to another company because there was a better phone that I wanted. I stayed there until my contract ran out and switched back to The Company because the coverage and price was so much better. I've been here for about 4 years and don't anticipate switching. I do wish they would get a larger selection of phones.
387,Terrible!!!! I stayed up all night and was second in line to buy the iphone 5s. While I was about to purchase it the sales rep said that because my area code isn't local that he couldn't give me the upgrade discount. Are you freaking kidding me? I just upgraded 6 months ago at the same location. I even called the call center and they said there was nothing they can do. I was just in the store a few days ago too and they didn't tell me that. I don't have one good reason to stay with at&t. As soon as I can get the 5s with The Company then I am terminating my contract with at&t. Please stay far away from at&t!! Horrible customer service.
512,The company's billing is very high and when they charge extra their explanation is confusing and they never send the bill at home the customer service people seen to be answering from a script they dont do much to help their customers I think is because I am under a contract. I think I can find a company at a better cost and the same service some where else most of my friends pay less than I do.
760,The manager in this store is rude like hell.only if he sees a beautiful woman he's a dog right away give all she needs.I really feel that this man in this location is a dick just because I'm an older woman I need to wait and as soon someone younger get into the store he give all the time and she's finish first than me I 'm very disappointing.
647,They care about me as a customer. They treat me with respect and I can tell they want to keep me as a customer. They also have the best network in Chicago.
728,This company is great! I have the National 1000 plan and get national incoming calls any where in us along with national nights and weekends starting @7pm and where in us along with local m2m and only pay $79.99 for 3 phones on this plan. this gives me the freedom to use my phone while on travel and vacation! i also have a blackberry plan on my account. these prices have become cheaper since first coming out which is awesome! i have only had maybe one dropped call since i got there service maybe 2 tops. My internet is fast and i use it all the time while out of town or even shopping to look things up! battery swap is great i can swap my battery if mine is running slow at any us cell store! If i ever have any billing questions i call or stop into store and sales reps are always very friendly and nice helping me resolve any problems that i have. i have never had to have any of our phones sent out for warranty and they always last us at least till our contract is up sometimes even longer!
16,We have been customers for over 5 years and will not switch. We have no reason to. We can't seem to find a better deal or better service anywhere else.
203,i have been with Another Company since they came to baltimore. i love them i pay 60.00 a month for unlimited everything and my warantee i have had a problem only one time with my phone and thats because i dropped it but i went to my local corporate store and for 20.00 i recieved a brand new phone. the oonly thing i dont like is theyy dont have a phone upgrade you pay flat out the price of the phone. if they fix that and give a discount for phone up grades they would get a perfect 10
427,Â I've been with iCompany - Another Company for 4 years now. I have never had a problem - never dropped a call I have free roaming free long distance which is great for my family inutah west virginia etc. I even get roll over minutes. Every time I called customer service they have always helped me and even have a 24/7 late niht number there always on call - this is the best plan / company I have ever had I plan to stay with them. The only thing I dont like is there plans arnt cheap but you get great service
289,"""-Badest customer service -Poor reception -Lots of drop off calls -Bad phones (may be factory refurb sold as new) -Long wait time if you call customer service, many times call disconnect or representative will put on hold for not less 30 min. or (s)he will"""
672,"""After 2 and a half years with one of the big companies, it is such a pleasure to deal with The Company. There was no pressure at all in choosing a phone. In fact, when I looked at more expensive ones, the representative encouraged me to look at something less flashy because it met my needs better. I appreciated that. There have been a couple of small errors in billing but they were quick to correct and credit my account. What a change from my old company where they gave me incorrect information,over-charged me $600, argued with me and said they were just too busy to go over the bill with me. Sometimes I have to wait to get help. But there is someone there who welcomes me, takes my name, offers to get water or coffee and just makes me feel valued. The company has even invested in comfortable chairs for customers who have to wait. I love The Company."""
56,"""BAD SERVICE! poor customer service! Not at all willing to listen and resolve issues. Sarcastic, nasty and should be drummed out of the business! Daughter has called and called and talked to several employees and they are sarcastic and demeaning to her! Not exactly the way a reputable company works. Disgusting."""
116,"""Beware of The Company. It's no more than a bunch of thieves. It took money from my credit card in Nov. When I complained, they told me the money will be applied back to my credit card within 24-48 hours, which did not happen. So far I had to called 25 times and go to the local store 4 times to get my money back. Most of the time they promised me I would receive the money in 24-48 hours. They acknowledged that they wrongfully took my money, but hesitated to return it. What a bunch of crooked thieves!"""
90,"""Buyer beware. You have no recourse with Another Company if you ever have any service problems. I have a new phone past the 30 days (5 months old). I am told I will have to wait a minimum of 5 business days to get a replacement phone during which time I will be totally without service. I travel 100 miles + daily and rely on my phone for emergencies and in the event I have car problems on the road. I will receive a refurbished phone (someone else's problem phone) and no additional extension to the warranty. The CS reps were very nice but are not allowed to go outside Another Company rules regardless of the circumstances. Another Company is and has always been a very uncaring and unconcerned organization when it comes to customer satisfaction. Their overall ratings bare this statement out from other surveys, and they still make no effort to improve or to take care of long term customers that they have never had any problems with. What does this tell you about Another Company? Draw your own conclusion."""
224,"""By far biggest bang for the buck. I do think they need to removing texting fees, but still by far best value for money in State 1 and State y."""
413,"""Carriers are evil; greed based, work with people to sue our kids, charge use twice or more for the same data/access (on example tethering) and bribe senators to take away our freedoms. Use alternative prepay options -- keep your freedoms and save money over the life of a typical plan."""
622,"""Coverage sucks. They claim to have coverage on their map in places they do not. The data only works half the time, the other half of the time it will endlessly load but never successfully access a webpage. If you have a new period of service beginning on the 9th and you have an automatic payment method on file, they will start trying to bill you on the 7th. Remember, you have already PAID for service, THROUGH the 8th, but if they have a problem processing your payment on the 7th they will cut your service off and send you an automated text message letting you know. That's stealing as far as I'm concerned. Also, customer service routes you to India, where even the most basic concerns are either misinterpreted due to language barriers or willfully ignored due to policy. Hard to tell."""
253,"""Dear God: PLEASE tell all these carriers that it is better to have 8mbps EVERYWHERE than to have 23 in one place and .5 in another. Just give me a network where if I have a signal, I have good speed. Not faster than cable, just good solid speed. Tmo is probably the only one capable of delivering this right away, but they still have Edge in too many places. I would have preferred if they had bypassed LTE for now and just rolled out HSPA+ 42 everywhere."""
355,"""First the Indian guy on the phone has the wrong address and keeps telling me i already have an account with U-verse before i even signed up. I kept telling him he had the wrong address but he didn't get it, because when I called back the next day and spoke to an American they still had the wrong address. Finally i was able to clear it up and get started. The first installation guy was supposed to come inside to make sure everything was ready for service I was told to be home for specific hours and had to take off work. I thought the guy never showed so i called and apparently he was just checking the outside of the building and left. When i wasn't able to get a signal with a self install i called them back they sent me a dumb tech who couldn't figure out how to install it either. He said somebody would be coming the next day who could fix it. I asked when and he didn't know just said to wait for a call. Later the next day my neighbor tells me a guy from at&t was on the first floor of the apartment, (I have no buzzers working and specified i must be called to be let in) and i live on the third floor. My neighbor said he waited less than 2 minutes and left without calling me. I swiftly canceled the service and got almost all my money back. During the week i ordered i was suggested to sign up for a hotline u can call to help u self install but if i didn't cancel after a week i would be charged $10. This company is hired by at&t to help customers but even though i never had service i was charged and couldn't get my money back. I had to spend an hour on the phone just to get the company name number and cancel. My last nightmare happened when i returned the modem ups lost it and i was charged $150 it was taken straight out of my account since i was forced to sign a contract with auto something to do with my low credit rating. I called asked what happened they said its lost and they would call me back. They never did two weeks later i found the receipt with the tracking number so i called them back. They got the modem, and said they were sending a request for a full rebate. I get a call today and they sent me a check for $100. I was charged $150. So i had to send another request for my $50 check they are calling me friday to make sure it goes through.

They sat with me on the phone for over 2 hours, going over it line by line and crediting back for every 3rd party purchase/download. It was a lot of time I didn't really have, but the lady, Lisa Goss, was absolutely amazing...patient and very, very nice. I was mad...you can't imagine how mad...and she was just great. Their customer service is usually really good anyway though. I think that is why we stick with them even with the other stuff. You just can't find good customer service anymore.Â """

149,"""I have been a The Company customer for a number of years, dating back to the other co days. The real problem with this company is a total lack of after-sales customer service: whether it be commercial or technical. It is extremely difficult (almost impossible) to obtain a knowledgeable agent to solve any problem. Generally the personnel are badly trained and badly informed. The real test of a company is not when everything is going well (as it should do!) but how they deal with a problem. The Company scores very, very low. In summary the service is ok as long as it works, but as soon as you have a problem you can not count on them for help. There are many other better phone companies to choose from!"""

The service has been o.k. for the most part. I get reception almost everywhere in NYC but I sometimes lose calls in parts of stores. The voice mail has recently become a problem. I will occasionally get messages a day after they were sent! This has cost me money. I have accumulated over 7000 rollover minutes. However, they are useless if I want to change my plan since I will lose them if I change plans. The customer service has been friendly on the 3-4 occasions that I have needed them. However, my calls to them were informational and not much was accomplished. The phones that I have received have functioned for the duration of the contract. On my last contract I had a Samsung phone where the screen went blank towards the end of the last contract. I waited until the end of the contract to get a new phone. For the money that I am paying, I should be getting internet service included. I am planning to switch to another carrier!"""
627,"""I have been with Another Company since 2008; never had a call dropped or issues with my handset. I started with the basic BASIC phone and now have the PinkBerry..other than my phone dying completely after a year and a 1/2 the phone itself is fine. I frequent the corporate office for any questions and needs, and the always have the best customer service. In the past year, I have added 3 other lines to my service and no one has a problem (other than they use the internet too much)"""

225,"""I have had The Company forEVER and feel very comfortable. Friends & Family was my main draw for a long time. Now that I am starting to count pennies a little more I realize that I have been paying for cream of the crop phone service for a long time. Time for me to bring it down a few notches and use the extra cash to pay off some debt. The Company costs a little more but IMO, if you can can afford why go elsewhere?"""
300,"""I have had The Company since October, 2002 and was off at college in the boonies. I've been on the same plan since then and get 1000 anytime minutes with free incoming calls/messages for $40/mo. The customer service is excellent and they're very flexible with me about upgrading my phone before my contract is up."""
486,"""I have tried out company x, another company, The Company, and The Company and i can absolutely say The Company is the worst carrier I have ever had. The service is nothing short of terrible, I live in the city and barely get one bar at times, and when i do miraculously have full bars it is still slower than molasses. On top of the horrible service, my phone would send out the same text up to six times, and sometimes i would send / receive texts the next day!! For your own sanity do not use The Company"""
22,"""I honestly don't understand all the negative comments regarding Another Company. I have had them as a carrier now for several years. I came from The Company who had consistently messed up my bill and over charged me and screwed things up all the time. They only seemed to be about the almighty dollar no matter how they had to get it. Another Company on the other hand has been great!! I have personally found that they will go way above and beyond when it comes to customer service. I had previously owned an HTC Aria. It was a complete lemon of a phone. I went thru the rules and as a result had three different phones sent to me via the warranty. By the time I was ready for phone number four I said there is no way I will take a fourth Aria, obviously it's just a poorly made phone. At which point, I asked to exchange for a Samsung Galaxy and they approved. I was thrilled with that phone and hung on to it until recently upgrading to the Galaxy Note, my new all time favorite phone EVER. Any time I have ever had questions about my bill, phone anything, Another Company has always taken care of my questions or concerns immediately...many times giving me a nice credit on my bill without even asking. Out of all the cell companies I have been with, hands down Another Company has the best customer service. I truly believe they care about their customers and keeping them! They have found ways to lower my monthly bill as well. I have never had a rude or unwilling customer service rep. I highly recommend this company. As far as paying your bill, simply download their app and pay your bill right thru there. Doesn't cost anything. Also, when I have had tough financial months, they are more than willing to work with you, rather than like many companies who just merely shut you down. If you make a payment arrangement with them and stick to it, they will make arrangements with you anytime and never interrupt service. I would never change carriers for nothing! Oh, and as far as quality cell phone service/range....I've never had a dropped call or anything. Very clear, consistant service and phone calls. If ppl are posting all negative about Another Company, I really question their situation...and I promise, I do not work for Another Company, never have and am not paid in any way to post this. Just a very happy customer who have been with them about 9 yrs."""
605,"""I just changed my plan to unlimited minutes, which was very easy to do. However, be aware that they make the change retroactive so that it takes effect from your normal billing date. For me this means that even though my billing cycle is half done they are billing me at the new unlimited rate for the entire billing cycle. In other words, I am paying for two weeks of a service which I never used. This is unfair and I would like to see The Company prorate these charges so that we pay for what we get."""
657,"""I ordered new service and was given different promotional information by three different representatives. When I realized that the plan I recently ordered five days prior did not offer me the complete promotional details for my area, I cancelled it. I then placed another order with the better promotion. That same day I received an email stating the order I had just placed was cancelled due to dual orders placed. I called to conflict issue and place yet another order. Well, now at&t wanted to run my credit for the third time within one week. I was approved two times prior. I felt that didn't make any sense. The rep stated that if I allow them to run my credit again, I may receive a better promotion as a new customer. As far as I was concerned I was still a new customer, since I never intercepted the merchandise and it was returned to them unopened. I never received any service. That was a true indicator of the customer service I would receive if I were to continue to proceed to receive the service.... The Company sucked ten years ago when they took ameritech and they STILL SUCK. NOT ABOUT THE CUSTOMER."""
643,"""I spent hours, days; weeks trying to get customer service, via phone and email, to little avail. I could NOT use my phone IN MY home, other than at the kitchen window, and even that was not dependable.

I am back to The Company, where I never had dropped calls. I now know why I pay a little more. Lesson learned!"" I purchased a The Company phone that turned out to be defective. Getting a replacement phone has been near to impossible - after having contacted the company and spent literally hours and hours and days and days on the phone waiting and talking to people who either could not or simply did not do what they said they would. I am still waiting to get this processed after TWO weeks of phone calls and waits and promises by 'supervisors' - they have lied and literally done nothing. They are terrible and I warn all to shop elsewhere - save yourself!!  ""been using The Company since 2010, voice quality is consistent not the best but all right all the time. i'm not text a lot but works all right. data speed is 3g but seems that the network that it uses (sprint) is busy so do not expect the best speed but still ok. customer service: I do all online so I don't have to call at all. last week called because reactivating my old phone online went wrong, had the issue fixed in 24 hours. have to say here that I have to program it manualy (instructions provided on the web page) and I did it wrong, so if I payed more attention on that I had ben called customer service one time on three years ! if you decide to get the service make sure to check the coverage area"" ""Their system seems to be so fouled up I actually feel sorry for the customer service reps. Actually, I don't feel that sorry for them. The company just cut my service off for no reason and now I've been sitting on the phone with them for fifteen minutes while this guy tries to figure out why. I also had to file a dispute form through my bank last month because the company had overcharged me $50 and magically could not find any record of it. That issue still has not been resolved. I could let fifty bucks slide but now it is a matter of principle. I'm pissed. Is the savings worth this crap?"" ""I bought the new HTC EVO 5 because it seemed like a good deal and the service price was a little cheaper than my T Mobile plan-big mistake,my internet and text messaging did not work after 3 days.

And dont even go with the service it is great have never not had 4g and always have good bars.  ""I am so disapointed of this company, since the moment I wanted to buy an iphone and join them I have a PO BOX as mailing address and was not possible to purchase it because of that.

I didn't have to wait the next bill cycle to get my plan or features changed. I get bars everywhere tmobile was not able to.

346,"""I switched to this carrier from a previous carrier. The Company has great coverage but dropped calls occasionally. Phone selection and customer service are the worst.

I switched to a smaller service company with way better plans, cheaper, and same phone selection and better customer service"""
435,"""I think if you're not sure which carrier to go with, ask people who live in your area. The most important to ongoing satisfaction: """"do you get reception? and do the calls drop?"""" Having more minutes and a cooler phone won't count if you can't get calls to work."""

I tried this 5 times and got nowhere while chatting with an agent who would also not give me any help. Finally, I DEMANDED a supervisor after the agent, Darwin, would not give me an email address for Customer Care. I spent a total of two hours on the phone and an 8 hour day connecting to The Company. It finally works, but if this is how it begins, I prefer not to continue with them. Since I received calls from them, I asked that they not add that time to my 300 minutes limit, but the responded by telling me I should have called *86. They just don't get it. CUSTOMER SERVICE with The Company, is a disservice and not at all sensitive to customer concerns."""
97,"""I was a loyal customer to Another Company service since Another Company first came out. I think that was the best cell phone service I have ever had.

When I heard The Company was taking over Another Company I cringed because I knew that was the end of Good service.

Avoid this company at all costs!!!"""
180,"""I would never switch companies from The Company. I mean The Company goes above and beyond for there customers, They are really great with customer privacy, not just let people who just say they should access acount, because they use a phone access and ruin accounts, and they also dont cancel customers contracts, just because they call into customer service like another company. If you can give a REAL bad example of customer service, and not blame them because you dont pay attention to your bill, your contract that you sign or because they just wont give you credits for all of your overage charges, because you were not responsible enough to watch your minutes. Then please tell us all."""
257,"""I've been with The Company for almost six years now and am quite shocked to see all the negative reviews! In six years, I've only had to call them maybe a handful of times, but they were always helpful and able to resolve my issue quickly. I live in So Cal and I've never had an issue with my service and I travel back and forth to Vegas at least once a month! The only exception was once when traveling to South Carolina (the service was a little spotty in some places back there). I just purchased the Samsung Galaxy S3 and I love it! I've had the phone for about 3 months now and have had ZERO ISSUES with the phone or the service! I pay $50.00 a month ($45 for the service and $5 for the phone insurance) and am very happy with my service that I receive.

774,"""I've been with The Company for many years and have not only selected them as a carrier for my employer but also recommended them to many friends and family members because of their strong customer service. As a regional carrier, their coverage has never been the greatest and their phone offerings are behind the curve and sometimes really disappointing in quality, but their superior customer service was what kept me as a loyal customer. Until recently. It seems they are now spending a lot of money advertising about their happy customers and apparently a lot less money on actual customer service. Today when I had an issue, I was transferred several times, treated with alternating rudeness or apathy and no one cared to fix my issue. And, in fact, they never did fix it. Even when I asked to speak to a customer service supervisor. Bottom line? The only thing they really had going for them was their great customer service. Since they don't have that anymore, there is no reason to consider them. Not to say some local places may not still have good customer service - but as a caution, their phone support center is now right up there with the worst of the worst."""

I went by Verison store and had to wait half an hour to get SIM installed. When I called customer to find out how to get pictures off old phone, was told by supervisor to take data card out. When I told her my phone did not have a data card she told me all phones had data card. When I asked her to tell me where it was in the Galaxy Nexus she then told me it did not have a data card I could remove. Went back to store where clerk told me to Bluetooth pictures to new phone but after several minutes of trying told me it would not work but she did not know why.

Then it automatically went into silent mode every time it went into sleep mode, and now it will neither send nor receive texts from anyone, except my phone itself.

Our phones didn't even last the year before they started dying out, but they wouldn't let us purchase new ones for anything less than $250. Then we moved to another town and couldn't even get service in our own home. So now that we've cancelled our service 8 months early, they are trying to charge us $450 PER PHONE!!! Our contract clearly states that they can charge us UP TO $350 PER ACCOUNT, definitely not $450 and definitely not per phone.

Most recently I got on and had the cheeriest, friendliest and genuinely eager person to help me with a billing issue (I was concerned about how much I'd be billed for accepting collect calls) She helped me, and it turned out I was billed nothing extra, But during our conversation when I mentioned I might have to lealve Another Company because I couldn't afford my plan (they do need to work on more affordable plans) she offered me a 40$ credit because of my loyalty thus far.

No offense to the people of Malaysia which is where the call center is I believe....couldn't understand a single word of one person and kept calling back until I found someone I could understand.Â """
566,"""been with them for 10 years. They are great! I had one problem with their connectivity quality and it was resolved loading a new PPL. I have an inexpensive plan, get coverage all over the USA, while people are spending 100s my bill is about $58, $6 of that is text messaging which I don't use all the much and $7 in taxes. They always answer the phone and solve my problem. NOT looking forward to being forced to go to The Company."""
434,"""Â After my plan ran up, I renewed my plan, but before doing so I told them that I would be moving to live in MA permanetly. I asked if I would get service and was told I would. However, after the 30 trial period was up, I was given a call telling me that I was not in a proper service area (though I had a nation wide plan). This was discovered only after I called and questioned why I was being charged almost double for my calls. And why I had been charged twice for my phone. The one stopped working after seven days (with no damgage done do it) and when I returned the phone for a new one, I was charged again on the bill. Despite the fact that the guy at the store said sometimes phones just stop working. I then recieved a call saying that since I was out of the service area (in MA) that my subscription would be terminated and I would be charged 150 dollars to do so. I called and spoke with someone out of the xx Customer Service Center and was told that I had no options other than to pay the 150 dollars or return my phone (not to be reimbursed and having to pay shipping costs).Â """
543,"""Â I was originally with a big company starting in 1995 and did not switch when The Company took over due to the fact that my contract would be grandfathered in. I have been more than happy with their service and prices. I have no incoming charges, nights for me stayed the same from Primeco free after 7pm, 1000 prime min. free. Free incoming texts. I do not see a need for those """"smart"""" phones since I have a nav system and a 10 disc sirus system in my vehicles, a PS3 at home, laptop and desktop computers at home and work just like everyone else. if you have to have a smart phone you are either a teenager or you are in dire need of a secretary."""
247,Go to all companies and see how different each one treats you. If they are pleasent its worth it. The Company is so much better and their customer service is a ten.
33,HATE HATE The Company MADE ME GOT THREW HELL HAD PROBLEMS WITH PIC MESSAGES AND RECIEVEING PIC MESSAGES AND LATER TURING ON MY CELL THEN I GOT MY HUSBANDS CONTACTS TO MY CELL AND HE GOT MINE I WILL NEVER GO BACK TO STUPID The Company EVER!!!!!!!
502,Horrible company to deal with. Defective phone arrived late. They wanted me to pay for returning a defective phone. You call them and wait hours for a live person. They then tell you they have to transfer you to a different department - they then disconnect you. You start all over again. Two hours later you are still nowhere. Ridiculous. I will never use them again. Ever. I would rather not have a cell phone than deal with them. They should be sued in a class action and have to pay millions of dollars. Even that would not be enough punishment for the hell they put me through.
110,I been with The Company since I bought my first android and the service has given me awsom coverage and its cheaper with the best monthly payment oppurtunities compare to other carriers and now I am using my 5th phone IPHONE 5 and The Company is the only carrier that has the cheapest monthly plan I have been really blessed by getting The Company ! love it..
80,I can't believe how unprofessional the staff is. My phone LCD (not the screen) cracked for some unknown reason. I went to get it replaced at the The Company store and they sent me to their repair center to get it replaced assuring me that they would have a replacement. I get to the The Company repair center and they stated that they do not carry the Galaxy S4 32GB and that I would have to call Phone Claim... I call phone claim and I order a replacement 32GB and they send me a 16GB Galaxy S4... I send it back and have to wait 6 days for it to get back to them... I wait the 6 days then call and they state that they received the phone and that the right version will be sent to me and arrive within 2 business days. It's been two business days and no phone... I call PhoneClaim and they stated that the phone has not been shipped... I ask why and they said it was not approved.. The lady on the phone sensed my stress and anger (I guess) and decided to speak to her manager and gets the phone shipped... (supposedly) we will see what happens... Service Sucks!!!
128,I can't say the rest of these reviews are real but I have been a no contract customer for over 5 years now and have not had any problems with the company or phones had sprint but couldn't afford them so I am glad to be out of their contract both myself and my son have the LG optimus elite and aside from normal battery issues will keep The Company mobile calls are not dropped sound is normal as any other phone um I would recommend them for many reasons
113,I have been a customer of this service for over 9 years and sometime in the last 2 years customer service and the quality of service has decreased greatly.
651,I have been using The Company for a little over a month. Love the value. $60/month for unlimited everything compared to my $120 with The Company. Call quality has been okay as I have had only 2 dropped calls in the time I have been with them and so far no major concerns with customer service. I get texts several days before reminding me to top up so I don't have service interruptions.
109,I have had service with The Company for almost two years. It's not the best but it is cheap. I finally upgraded my phone from the lg optimus to samsung galaxy. Really better phone all together. But know I'm trying to put service back on my old phone. And it's not taking. I have called tech support 5 times and received and ridicules excuse why its not working. Each tech has done exactly the same 5 steps the previous tech did. Didn't solve the problem. They document that I have had problems from the begining. Yet they can't solve the problem but they are great at passing the buck to another tech. So know I'm waiting 24-72 hours for a call back for that tech to reset the phone and still have the same problems. These phones are not complicated. There is only so much you can do before they realise it is the phone. I've told them it is the phone. Well know I have to clear my schedule for a phone call. Great!
49,I spent a couple hours on the phone with apple and at&t today about my boyfriend's lost phone. I kept getting comments from both ends about why one provider was better than the other. Apple put me on hold for a LONG time and the advice they gave me was something I had already done. Karen Johnson from The Company was awesome and patient and actually gave me good answers and advice.
10,Overall I am very satisfied with The Company. I had The Company for about 3 years and switched to another company because there was a better phone that I wanted. I stayed there until my contract ran out and switched back to The Company because the coverage and price was so much better. I've been here for about 4 years and don't anticipate switching. I do wish they would get a larger selection of phones.
361,Terrible!!!! I stayed up all night and was second in line to buy the iphone 5s. While I was about to purchase it the sales rep said that because my area code isn't local that he couldn't give me the upgrade discount. Are you freaking kidding me? I just upgraded 6 months ago at the same location. I even called the call center and they said there was nothing they can do. I was just in the store a few days ago too and they didn't tell me that. I don't have one good reason to stay with at&t. As soon as I can get the 5s with The Company then I am terminating my contract with at&t. Please stay far away from at&t!! Horrible customer service.
27,The company's billing is very high and when they charge extra their explanation is confusing and they never send the bill at home the customer service people seen to be answering from a script they dont do much to help their customers I think is because I am under a contract. I think I can find a company at a better cost and the same service some where else most of my friends pay less than I do.
602,The manager in this store is rude like hell.only if he sees a beautiful woman he's a dog right away give all she needs.I really feel that this man in this location is a dick just because I'm an older woman I need to wait and as soon someone younger get into the store he give all the time and she's finish first than me I 'm very disappointing.
658,They care about me as a customer. They treat me with respect and I can tell they want to keep me as a customer. They also have the best network in Chicago.
283,This company is great! I have the National 1000 plan and get national incoming calls any where in us along with national nights and weekends starting @7pm and where in us along with local m2m and only pay $79.99 for 3 phones on this plan. this gives me the freedom to use my phone while on travel and vacation! i also have a blackberry plan on my account. these prices have become cheaper since first coming out which is awesome! i have only had maybe one dropped call since i got there service maybe 2 tops. My internet is fast and i use it all the time while out of town or even shopping to look things up! battery swap is great i can swap my battery if mine is running slow at any us cell store! If i ever have any billing questions i call or stop into store and sales reps are always very friendly and nice helping me resolve any problems that i have. i have never had to have any of our phones sent out for warranty and they always last us at least till our contract is up sometimes even longer!
166,We have been customers for over 5 years and will not switch. We have no reason to. We can't seem to find a better deal or better service anywhere else.
377,i have been with Another Company since they came to baltimore. i love them i pay 60.00 a month for unlimited everything and my warantee i have had a problem only one time with my phone and thats because i dropped it but i went to my local corporate store and for 20.00 i recieved a brand new phone. the oonly thing i dont like is theyy dont have a phone upgrade you pay flat out the price of the phone. if they fix that and give a discount for phone up grades they would get a perfect 10
456,Â I've been with iCompany - Another Company for 4 years now. I have never had a problem - never dropped a call I have free roaming free long distance which is great for my family inutah west virginia etc. I even get roll over minutes. Every time I called customer service they have always helped me and even have a 24/7 late niht number there always on call - this is the best plan / company I have ever had I plan to stay with them. The only thing I dont like is there plans arnt cheap but you get great service
369,"""-Badest customer service -Poor reception -Lots of drop off calls -Bad phones (may be factory refurb sold as new) -Long wait time if you call customer service, many times call disconnect or representative will put on hold for not less 30 min. or (s)he will"""
562,"""After 2 and a half years with one of the big companies, it is such a pleasure to deal with The Company. There was no pressure at all in choosing a phone. In fact, when I looked at more expensive ones, the representative encouraged me to look at something less flashy because it met my needs better. I appreciated that. There have been a couple of small errors in billing but they were quick to correct and credit my account. What a change from my old company where they gave me incorrect information,over-charged me $600, argued with me and said they were just too busy to go over the bill with me. Sometimes I have to wait to get help. But there is someone there who welcomes me, takes my name, offers to get water or coffee and just makes me feel valued. The company has even invested in comfortable chairs for customers who have to wait. I love The Company."""
596,"""BAD SERVICE! poor customer service! Not at all willing to listen and resolve issues. Sarcastic, nasty and should be drummed out of the business! Daughter has called and called and talked to several employees and they are sarcastic and demeaning to her! Not exactly the way a reputable company works. Disgusting."""
314,"""Beware of The Company. It's no more than a bunch of thieves. It took money from my credit card in Nov. When I complained, they told me the money will be applied back to my credit card within 24-48 hours, which did not happen. So far I had to called 25 times and go to the local store 4 times to get my money back. Most of the time they promised me I would receive the money in 24-48 hours. They acknowledged that they wrongfully took my money, but hesitated to return it. What a bunch of crooked thieves!"""
678,"""Buyer beware. You have no recourse with Another Company if you ever have any service problems. I have a new phone past the 30 days (5 months old). I am told I will have to wait a minimum of 5 business days to get a replacement phone during which time I will be totally without service. I travel 100 miles + daily and rely on my phone for emergencies and in the event I have car problems on the road. I will receive a refurbished phone (someone else's problem phone) and no additional extension to the warranty. The CS reps were very nice but are not allowed to go outside Another Company rules regardless of the circumstances. Another Company is and has always been a very uncaring and unconcerned organization when it comes to customer satisfaction. Their overall ratings bare this statement out from other surveys, and they still make no effort to improve or to take care of long term customers that they have never had any problems with. What does this tell you about Another Company? Draw your own conclusion."""

84,"""Carriers are evil; greed based, work with people to sue our kids, charge use twice or more for the same data/access (on example tethering) and bribe senators to take away our freedoms. Use alternative prepay options -- keep your freedoms and save money over the life of a typical plan."""
230,"""Coverage sucks. They claim to have coverage on their map in places they do not. The data only works half the time, the other half of the time it will endlessly load but never successfully access a webpage. If you have a new period of service beginning on the 9th and you have an automatic payment method on file, they will start trying to bill you on the 7th. Remember, you have already PAID for service, THROUGH the 8th, but if they have a problem processing your payment on the 7th they will cut your service off and send you an automated text message letting you know. That's stealing as far as I'm concerned. Also, customer service routes you to India, where even the most basic concerns are either misinterpreted due to language barriers or willfully ignored due to policy. Hard to tell."""
256,"""Dear God: PLEASE tell all these carriers that it is better to have 8mbps EVERYWHERE than to have 23 in one place and .5 in another. Just give me a network where if I have a signal, I have good speed. Not faster than cable, just good solid speed. Tmo is probably the only one capable of delivering this right away, but they still have Edge in too many places. I would have preferred if they had bypassed LTE for now and just rolled out HSPA+ 42 everywhere."""
552,"""First the Indian guy on the phone has the wrong address and keeps telling me i already have an account with U-verse before i even signed up. I kept telling him he had the wrong address but he didn't get it, because when I called back the next day and spoke to an American they still had the wrong address. Finally i was able to clear it up and get started. The first installation guy was supposed to come inside to make sure everything was ready for service I was told to be home for specific hours and had to take off work. I thought the guy never showed so i called and apparently he was just checking the outside of the building and left. When i wasn't able to get a signal with a self install i called them back they sent me a dumb tech who couldn't figure out how to install it either. He said somebody would be coming the next day who could fix it. I asked when and he didn't know just said to wait for a call. Later the next day my neighbor tells me a guy from at&t was on the first floor of the apartment, (I have no buzzers working and specified i must be called to be let in) and i live on the third floor. My neighbor said he waited less than 2 minutes and left without calling me. I swiftly canceled the service and got almost all my money back. During the week i ordered i was suggested to sign up for a hotline u can call to help u self install but if i didn't cancel after a week i would be charged $10. This company is hired by at&t to help customers but even though i never had service i was charged and couldn't get my money back. I had to spend an hour on the phone just to get the company name number and cancel. My last nightmare happened when i returned the modem ups lost it and i was charged $150 it was taken straight out of my account since i was forced to sign a contract with auto something to do with my low credit rating. I called asked what happened they said its lost and they would call me back. They never did two weeks later i found the receipt with the tracking number so i called them back. They got the modem, and said they were sending a request for a full rebate. I get a call today and they sent me a check for $100. I was charged $150. So i had to send another request for my $50 check they are calling me friday to make sure it goes through.

It was a lot of time I didn't really have, but the lady, Lisa Goss, was absolutely amazing...patient and very, very nice. I was mad...you can't imagine how mad...and she was just great. Their customer service is usually really good anyway though. I think that is why we stick with them even with the other stuff. You just can't find good customer service anymore.Â """

74,"""I have been a The Company customer for a number of years, dating back to the other co days. The real problem with this company is a total lack of after-sales customer service: whether it be commercial or technical. It is extremely difficult (almost impossible) to obtain a knowledgeable agent to solve any problem. Generally the personnel are badly trained and badly informed. The real test of a company is not when everything is going well (as it should do!) but how they deal with a problem. The Company scores very, very low. In summary the service is ok as long as it works, but as soon as you have a problem you can not count on them for help. There are many other better phone companies to choose from!"""

I will occasionally get messages a day after they were sent! This has cost me money. I have accumulated over 7000 rollover minutes. However, they are useless if I want to change my plan since I will lose them if I change plans. The customer service has been friendly on the 3-4 occasions that I have needed them. However, my calls to them were informational and not much was accomplished. The phones that I have received have functioned for the duration of the contract. On my last contract I had a Samsung phone where the screen went blank towards the end of the last contract. I waited until the end of the contract to get a new phone.

67,"""I honestly don't understand all the negative comments regarding Another Company. I have had them as a carrier now for several years. I came from The Company who had consistently messed up my bill and over charged me and screwed things up all the time. They only seemed to be about the almighty dollar no matter how they had to get it. Another Company on the other hand has been great!! I have personally found that they will go way above and beyond when it comes to customer service. I had previously owned an HTC Aria. It was a complete lemon of a phone. I went thru the rules and as a result had three different phones sent to me via the warranty. By the time I was ready for phone number four I said there is no way I will take a fourth Aria, obviously it's just a poorly made phone. At which point, I asked to exchange for a Samsung Galaxy and they approved. I was thrilled with that phone and hung on to it until recently upgrading to the Galaxy Note, my new all time favorite phone EVER. Any time I have ever had questions about my bill, phone anything, Another Company has always taken care of my questions or concerns immediately...many times giving me a nice credit on my bill without even asking. Out of all the cell companies I have been with, hands down Another Company has the best customer service. I truly believe they care about their customers and keeping them! They have found ways to lower my monthly bill as well. I have never had a rude or unwilling customer service rep. I highly recommend this company. As far as paying your bill, simply download their app and pay your bill right thru there. Doesn't cost anything. Also, when I have had tough financial months, they are more than willing to work with you, rather than like many companies who just merely shut you down. If you make a payment arrangement with them and stick to it, they will make arrangements with you anytime and never interrupt service. I would never change carriers for nothing! Oh, and as far as quality cell phone service/range....I've never had a dropped call or anything. Very clear, consistant service and phone calls. If ppl are posting all negative about Another Company, I really question their situation...and I promise, I do not work for Another Company, never have and am not paid in any way to post this. Just a very happy customer who have been with them about 9 yrs."""
248,"""I just changed my plan to unlimited minutes, which was very easy to do. However, be aware that they make the change retroactive so that it takes effect from your normal billing date. For me this means that even though my billing cycle is half done they are billing me at the new unlimited rate for the entire billing cycle. In other words, I am paying for two weeks of a service which I never used. This is unfair and I would like to see The Company prorate these charges so that we pay for what we get."""

Well, now at&t wanted to run my credit for the third time within one week. I was approved two times prior. I felt that didn't make any sense. The rep stated that if I allow them to run my credit again, I may receive a better promotion as a new customer. As far as I was concerned I was still a new customer, since I never intercepted the merchandise and it was returned to them unopened. I never received any service. That was a true indicator of the customer service I would receive if I were to continue to proceed to receive the service....

""been using The Company since 2010, voice quality is consistent not the best but all right all the time. i'm not text a lot but works all right. data speed is 3g but seems that the network that it uses (sprint) is busy so do not expect the best speed but still ok. customer service: I do all online so I don't have to call at all. last week called because reactivating my old phone online went wrong, had the issue fixed in 24 hours. have to say here that I have to program it manualy (instructions provided on the web page) and I did it wrong, so if I payed more attention on that I had ben called customer service one time on three years ! if you decide to get the service make sure to check the coverage area"" ""Their system seems to be so fouled up I actually feel sorry for the customer service reps. Actually, I don't feel that sorry for them. The company just cut my service off for no reason and now I've been sitting on the phone with them for fifteen minutes while this guy tries to figure out why. I also had to file a dispute form through my bank last month because the company had overcharged me $50 and magically could not find any record of it. That issue still has not been resolved. I could let fifty bucks slide but now it is a matter of principle. I'm pissed. Is the savings worth this crap?"" ""I bought the new HTC EVO 5 because it seemed like a good deal and the service price was a little cheaper than my T Mobile plan-big mistake,my internet and text messaging did not work after 3 days. Their tech support is a pain in the ass to reach the right person to talk to and they are all clueless,i wasted so much time being on hold to get no fix to any of my problems and then they told me i might be without coverage for days,with no view on the horizon when it would be fixed,my easy solution was to return the phone and cancel service(their service was so glitched they couldn't even locate my account through my phone number i might add) and went right back to T Mobile-look it's simply not worth saving a few dollars to go with them if you don't want a headache and the worst customer service of any company i've ever dealt with-STAY AWAY!!!!!!!!!!!!!"" After weeks of researching for a perfect plan for me and my family I found The Company to be to best option to suite our needs. after many years with att and The Company and after switching to The Company had really been a significiant saving I had figured out that The Companys phones are bit more exspensive but with the plan in really pays off. And dont even go with the service it is great have never not had 4g and always have good bars.  ""I am so disapointed of this company, since the moment I wanted to buy an iphone and join them I have a PO BOX as mailing address and was not possible to purchase it because of that. They made me waste my time over the phone with actually 4 representatives and the last one told me the truth. Comon The Company mobil If your goal is became a big phone company you have to pass to XXI century"""
655,"""I switched from The Companye because of its Bad Customer Service, bars, droped calls. Made me wait 2 hours Paying for 2 phones $220 no addons. I joined iCompany who's customer care actually cares they fixed my problems in just a matter of minutes and were very nice. I didn't have to wait the next bill cycle to get my plan or features changed. I get bars everywhere tmobile was not able to. People told me Tmobile's problem is temp. and will be fixed in about a month two months later still like that. I even talked to my friend who is an manager at tmobile(he doesn't use tmobile himself hates it) and he said this problem isn't a temp. problem this will be a problem. Att has higher pricing than tmobile but is way worth it..."""
42,"""I switched to this carrier from a previous carrier. The Company has great coverage but dropped calls occasionally. Phone selection and customer service are the worst. In any The Company store mise well have an hour or more to spare to do anything. I switched to a smaller service company with way better plans, cheaper, and same phone selection and better customer service"""
524,"""I think if you're not sure which carrier to go with, ask people who live in your area. The most important to ongoing satisfaction: """"do you get reception? and do the calls drop?"""" Having more minutes and a cooler phone won't count if you can't get calls to work."""
77,"""I took a plan which included four lines and unlimited talk and text and data for $350 a month,However when I got my first bill it was $1,250.00. I called to ask why but never recieved a straight answer! Stay away or you will loose all your money and most likely end up cussing some guy from India out !"""
485,"""I tried to get service through a store. After they entered all of the necessary information they got a message that the activation center was not available. I came home and entered all of the information again, then got the same message. I chatted online and then tried again, but got the same message. Then when I called Customer Care per chat instructions, I got the message to contact my service provider and a hang up. I tried this 5 times and got nowhere while chatting with an agent who would also not give me any help. Finally, I DEMANDED a supervisor after the agent, Darwin, would not give me an email address for Customer Care. I spent a total of two hours on the phone and an 8 hour day connecting to The Company. It finally works, but if this is how it begins, I prefer not to continue with them. Since I received calls from them, I asked that they not add that time to my 300 minutes limit, but the responded by telling me I should have called *86. They just don't get it. CUSTOMER SERVICE with The Company, is a disservice and not at all sensitive to customer concerns."""
412,"""I was a loyal customer to Another Company service since Another Company first came out. I think that was the best cell phone service I have ever had. There was responsible billing, great customer service, and my bill was actually something I look forward to. Now I get charged for """"Looking at the phone"""" before I even make a phone call. When I heard The Company was taking over Another Company I cringed because I knew that was the end of Good service. The service has gone to the dumps with The Company and I can't wait for my contract to end so that I can finally be one of the many who will make The Company bankrupt. The Company """"we drop calls as well as customers""""."""
220,"""I was looking for a smart phone with no contract. I saw the ZTE phone and it looked like a good deal. Where do I start with how bad this phone is. Phone said $55 month for unlimited data and internet, and 1,000 minutes a month. Monthly service was over $60 a month, Couldn't watch anything except youtube, 3g was spotty at best, phone froze twice and I had to call customer service to reboot it, both times losing all my contacts. Coverage area is a joke. Battery life, even with a battery saver app, was very short. The phone was so bad I purchased another phone with 3 weeks left on my Another Company service!!! Avoid this company at all costs!!!"""
635,"""I would never switch companies from The Company. I mean The Company goes above and beyond for there customers, They are really great with customer privacy, not just let people who just say they should access acount, because they use a phone access and ruin accounts, and they also dont cancel customers contracts, just because they call into customer service like another company. If you can give a REAL bad example of customer service, and not blame them because you dont pay attention to your bill, your contract that you sign or because they just wont give you credits for all of your overage charges, because you were not responsible enough to watch your minutes. Then please tell us all."""
402,"""I've been with The Company for almost six years now and am quite shocked to see all the negative reviews! In six years, I've only had to call them maybe a handful of times, but they were always helpful and able to resolve my issue quickly. I live in So Cal and I've never had an issue with my service and I travel back and forth to Vegas at least once a month! The only exception was once when traveling to South Carolina (the service was a little spotty in some places back there). I just purchased the Samsung Galaxy S3 and I love it! I've had the phone for about 3 months now and have had ZERO ISSUES with the phone or the service! I pay $50.00 a month ($45 for the service and $5 for the phone insurance) and am very happy with my service that I receive. I know a lot of other people who have The Company as well across the US and they love it as well, so I'm really at a loss to see this many people who are so angry with The Company."""
641,"""I've been with The Company for many years and have not only selected them as a carrier for my employer but also recommended them to many friends and family members because of their strong customer service. As a regional carrier, their coverage has never been the greatest and their phone offerings are behind the curve and sometimes really disappointing in quality, but their superior customer service was what kept me as a loyal customer. Until recently. It seems they are now spending a lot of money advertising about their happy customers and apparently a lot less money on actual customer service. Today when I had an issue, I was transferred several times, treated with alternating rudeness or apathy and no one cared to fix my issue. And, in fact, they never did fix it. Even when I asked to speak to a customer service supervisor. Bottom line? The only thing they really had going for them was their great customer service. Since they don't have that anymore, there is no reason to consider them. Not to say some local places may not still have good customer service - but as a caution, their phone support center is now right up there with the worst of the worst."""
432,"""I've been with The Company since they were Cell One, or basically 11 years. I've had friendly customer service, and good reception. I have maybe one dropped call every 2-3 years. I've had no real problems until I reduced my minutes at their recommendation, and proceded to go over my minutes by 650 minutes! I had no warning by them as to my minute usage, and they claimed absolutely no responsibility or leniency when I got a $400 bill.Â """
26,"""I've had a lot of interactions with The Company over the years and they have been pleasant. Good coverage, good reception. No dropped calls. Good phones whether you go cheap or expensive."""
53,"""I've only been a customer with them for 3 months now but i have to say they are an exceptional company. I was a little skeptical at first because when i told everyone i was gonna try The Company i got all kind of """"don't do it's!"""". But so far so good i have not had ONE dropped call and my reception is almost ALWAYS on 4 bars. I would recommend them to anyone in the midwest. I wish they had the company in all 50 states i would recommend them to my family in other states!"""
315,"""If you live in the regional or """"wide"""" area that The Company covers you are in great shape with this company. After a year and a half of selling their product I can tell you that they are not full of $H%# when they say """"we believe in something better"""". That being said, there are always going to be people that aren't as helpful as others. So call back and speak to another representative or try going to a retail/corporate store. The company as a whole does try to the right thing for their customers, I assure you."""
336,"""If you want the best go with The Company, but if you want okay for cheap go for The Company. The phone service is good in populated areas. The internet is okay on 3G. I cannot speak for 4G, because the iPhone 4S does not have 4G. For the money, The Company is a good deal."""
243,"""Just got my fifth phone since last July. They sent phone that said SIM card press-installed but was not. When turned new phone on turned old phone off. I had 3 phone and none would work. Called customer service because they had not sent tool to install SIM in new phone but they did not tell me I could use a paper clip. I went by Verison store and had to wait half an hour to get SIM installed. When I called customer to find out how to get pictures off old phone, was told by supervisor to take data card out. When I told her my phone did not have a data card she told me all phones had data card. When I asked her to tell me where it was in the Galaxy Nexus she then told me it did not have a data card I could remove. Went back to store where clerk told me to Bluetooth pictures to new phone but after several minutes of trying told me it would not work but she did not know why. She also told me it was all my fault for buying a phone without a removable data card even though a sales person at the store had directed me to the Nexus last July. To The Company the customer is always wrong!"""
666,"""My ZTE phone had problems from the beginning. It took 4 calls to get it activated properly. I've wasted countless minutes trying to get help from their ridiculous excuse for a technical support department, as well as the manufacturer. I even took my phone back to the store from which I purchased it and none of them could fix it. First, the touchscreen stopped responding. The music search was a joke. Then it automatically went into silent mode every time it went into sleep mode, and now it will neither send nor receive texts from anyone, except my phone itself. I am disgusted and frustrated with this sham of a company and would never recommend it to anyone. It truly is a waste of time and your hard-earned money."""
763,"""My family has been with The Company for YEARS and I mean years and have never had any problems with the customer service or service quality. In truth we live in the mountains and I get better signal on my phone then my friend does on her Verison phone. As for the internet phones I JUST upgraded my phone to a huawei Ascend 2 a couple days ago so i dont have a strong oppinion on it yet. I'm just saying you can read all the reviews you want but the best thing to do is to try it for yourself. I personally love The Company and suggest it strongly to my friends. I went traveling to the east coast two years back and went all up and down the coast and had reception ALL the way. As well as it didn't charge me extra roaming fees. Personally I love it. Sincerely, Loyal to a T FYI for all you out there no phone company is perfect. There will ALWAYS be problems no matter what one your with."""
563,"""My fiance and i signed a 2-year agreement in December of 2011 with brand new phones. Our monthly bill was $180, which we soon changed to the share everything plan but they were still charging us $165; every month they would tell us we were going over in our data, but when we would check it ourselves on our phones or by going in to a store we were fine, but yet they would still charge us for it. Our phones didn't even last the year before they started dying out, but they wouldn't let us purchase new ones for anything less than $250. Then we moved to another town and couldn't even get service in our own home. So now that we've cancelled our service 8 months early, they are trying to charge us $450 PER PHONE!!! Our contract clearly states that they can charge us UP TO $350 PER ACCOUNT, definitely not $450 and definitely not per phone. Signing a contract with The Company was nothing but a constant hassle and rip-off. I wouldn't recommend them to anyone."""
752,"""Never give help when you need it. When you call them, they take forever to answer. When they answer, there is nothing they can really do to help you. Even if you are a long-time costumer, even 12 to 13 years, they still treat you as a new costumer. Someone that they don't care about. They are the worst company I've ever known. Do not go for this company! It's terrible. Bad costumer service. Bad cell reception. They charge you for 3G, even when you don't use it. They are overpriced, you can definitely find a better cell company for less money and better quality. Pass it on."""
440,"""Okay So The Company... is a bit overpriced, and there have been a couple of times i've chatted with someone on customer assistance that clearly didn't quite grasp what I was talking about. But I've been with them since 2006 and seriously that has happened maybe twice. Most recently I got on and had the cheeriest, friendliest and genuinely eager person to help me with a billing issue (I was concerned about how much I'd be billed for accepting collect calls) She helped me, and it turned out I was billed nothing extra, But during our conversation when I mentioned I might have to lealve Another Company because I couldn't afford my plan (they do need to work on more affordable plans) she offered me a 40$ credit because of my loyalty thus far. I am seriously pleased with Another Company and always have been, if I switch companies it is strictly a financial move."""
473,"""Overall, if you are in the East and Midwest, I highly recommend this company. I actually ENJOY going into their stores and looking at new phones. They never push anything. Five Stars out of Five."""
420,"""Short story is this, The Company only cares about your money. If they feel they are not getting enough of it they will find a way (any way) to bill you for more of it. Don't like it, tough. It was cheaper to pay the $150 to get out of my The Company """"mafia"""" contract and go The Company, although, I now have to watch my back as I'm told that they have a contract out on me for doing this. The Company has a legal license to steal your money and there is NOTHING you can do about it."""
547,"""Summary: I have never had a problem with at&t when it comes down to my cell phone carrier. Ive been with them for 10 years now, and have had nothing but good things to say for them. I love theyre phones, and theyre customer service is as friendly as can be. theyre so helpful!"""
