    "How can we use **Vantage** to extract insights and tell a story behind a dataset? In this workflow you will see how powerful and simple the **Vantage Jupyter Extensions** are to use to extract answers from a public dataset available through Data.gov. We will analyze the number of complaints over time, using SQL in a Jupyter notebook powered by **Vantage** to answer the following questions:\n",
    "\n",
    "*What are the trends of complaints over time?*\n",
    "*How can we interpret the outliers in the dataset?*\n",
    "\n",
    "By answering questions like the ones above, we will gain a deeper understanding of the dataset and we'll be able to explain in plain English how the number of complaints evolve over time. In the **Explore** section, we will focus on analyzing the number of complaints over time and identifying trends and outliers in the time series to answer the questions above. All of this will be executed in a Teradata SQL JupyterLab environment that is fueled by **Vantage** and allows us even to plot charts and visualize the query results right on the notebook.\n",
