# Compute Groups

Group admins can create, edit, and delete Compute Groups (COGs).

A COG is a cluster of nodes similar to a multinode Teradata database instance, and do not have their own permanent storage. COGs enable elasticity and extensive computer power in the cloud, and they can easily grow and shrink as resource demands shift without service interruption.
