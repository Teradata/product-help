## Vantage Path - Using path analysis for behavior analysis with no coding

#### Note: Use TDPRD3 to run this use case

### Introduction

nPath is an SQL extension designed to perform fast analysis on ordered data.

Vantage Path provides user interfaces that help business users and data scientists understand patterns in customer behavior and to build advanced predictive models. The models use Vantage Machine Learning Engine (ML Engine). Vantage Path incorporates nPath and Sessionize analytic functions running within ML Engine. Users select events and parameters to explore event data, identify patterns, and reveal customer journeys.

Similiar to the nPath use case, Vantage Path helps track paths that lead to an outcome. But instead of writing SQL, it's just point and click!

### Telco Churn Example

In the telecommunications industry, addressing account closure, or churn, is a massive cost-saving effort. Using nPath analysis can target ways in which to improve retention by understanding customer behavior.

The initial step involves creating an event table to integrate interactions and transactions involving the customer. By capturing the events you can view the customerâ€™s journey, which may have involved visiting a store, going to the website, calling the support line, upgrading service, and canceling service.

Using nPath analysis, you can now click on the events to answer business questions, such as:

- What paths are my customers taking on the website?
- What paths are my customers taking before calling the support line?
- What paths are my customers before canceling their service?

### Experience

The entire use case takes about 5 minutes to run.

1. Open the <a href="/path-analyzer">Vantage Path</a>.
2. Select the system connection and authenticate.
3. Select the following "Event database": TRNG_Telco.
4. Select the following "Event table": telco_events.
5. Select additional parameters or just click "RUN" and analyze the results.

### Adding Additional Parameters

You may decide to use additional parameters for additional analysis

Top paths to show: Defines the number of pattern-matching paths to display
Event A: Initial event in the search pattern
Event B: Ending event in the search pattern
Minimum event count: Minimum number of events in the path pattern
Maximum event count: Maximum number of events in the path pattern

### Exporting Results

#### Example 1 - 'Export a list of customers who are on the path to churn.'

In order to "Create Segement" a table in the destination datasource needs to exist with the structure below. 


```sql
CREATE SET TABLE path_save_segment
(
     entity_id VARCHAR(100),
     path VARCHAR(2000)
);
```

#### Example 2 - 'Save the model query'

In order to "Save Query" a table in the destination datasource needs to exist with the structure below.


```sql
CREATE SET TABLE path_segment_queries
(
 id        VARCHAR(100),
 name      VARCHAR(1000),
 query     VARCHAR(32000)
);
```

#### Example 3 - 'Operationalize the results with workflow'

Workflow can be used in order to run the results of the path analysis on a schedule. The path analysis can either be saved and then used directly in a path node, or the SQL can be exported and placed in a SQL ndoe. To use the SQL in a workflow simply "Show SQL" and copy the SQL from your browser window. These results can then be pasted into any <a href="/workflow/">workflow</a> SQL node. The "Show SQL "functionality can also be useful in understanding how the SQL was constructed.

### Clean-up

When you are finished with this example, remember to clean up the created tables:

```sql
DROP TABLE path_save_segment;
```

```sql
DROP TABLE path_segment_queries;
```
