Personal access tokens (PATs) are used with Flow, user-defined functions, and the Open Analytics Framework in VantageCloud Lake. PATs use a public key/private key pair.

From the Navigation panel, select your **Account Settings** > **Access tokens and keys** to create a public key or access tokens.

From the Create key page, you can select the following:

-   Generate key pair – this is the private half of the key pair generated. Be sure to select **Download** to save the private key.


-   Upload public key – enter your public key and save.


Both the public key and private key names cannot be blank, must have unique names for each user, and cannot exceed 128 characters.

Once you have the key pair, select **Access tokens** in Account settings and **Create access token**. Make sure to select **Copy Access Token** and save your access token in a secure location. Teradata does not retain the access token information.
