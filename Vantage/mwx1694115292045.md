An organization admin can view and manage all user's [personal access tokens](syi1695940519543.md) (PATs).

From the Navigation panel, select **Home** > **Manage access** > **Access tokens**.

Revoking a user's token immediately revokes any active logins that are running in the Vantage Console for that user.
