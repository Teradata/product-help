As a database administrator, you can create, edit, restore, and view the history of backup plans.

From the navigation panel, select **Environments** > the environment > **Data protection**.

**Note:** You cannot create a partial backup plan or delete an existing backup plan. Contact your Teradata account team for these operations.
