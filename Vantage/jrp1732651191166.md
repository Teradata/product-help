Performance drift involves using a metric to compare predicted and actual data results. If actual data is not available, you can use drift in prediction and feature distributions to identify changes in the model.

ModelOps displays the details of the model version that was deployed in production. The Model drift monitoring area shows the evaluation metrics plotted over time to compare and monitor model performance over time.

The statistics of all selected metrics are presented in tiles. The information includes the current value of the metric, the comparison of the current value and the previous value of the metric, and the initial value of the metric.
