You can view the details of current or completed queries in the **Queries** and **Unified Query Monitoring** pages.

Descriptions of some key technical details:

-   **Primary cluster – Request AMP CPU**

    Total CPU seconds consumed to run the query on the primary cluster.


-   **Primary cluster – Request AMP IO**

    Total number of disk I/Os performed while executing on the primary cluster.


-   **Request count**

    Number of queries submitted by the session.


-   **Workload name**

    Name of the workload where the query is actively running.


-   **Compute group – Request AMP CPU**

    Average of the total CPU seconds consumed to run the query on compute groups.


-   **Compute group – Request AMP IO**

    Average of the total number of disk I/Os performed while executing on the compute groups.


-   **Unnecessary IO**

    All AMP I/O divided by all AMP CPU, displayed in milliseconds, to reveal large amounts of I/O occurring over a short period of time.


The SQL tab displays the SQL for the selected query. SQL for queries running on the primary cluster can be exported using the download ![""](Images/qie1590719586762.svg) button. You can also copy ![""](Images/cty1620686895907.svg) the script to use in Editor. This information is read-only.
