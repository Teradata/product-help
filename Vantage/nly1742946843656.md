Enter the name and description for the vector store. Be as descriptive as possible to help other users when asking contextual questions.

The types of **Content-based** data are:

-   **Prepared data**

    -   Prepared data is pre-loaded data that lives in a database table.


    -   Upload chunked text into a VARCHAR or CHAR column in a table that resides in the same database as the vector store.


-   **Raw data**

    -   Raw data lives on your local storage that will be converted into vectors.


    -   Only PDFs are supported.


To use a specific **Location** for the vector store instead of the current database, disable the **Default** option and search and select a database from the menu.

**Notes**:

-   Once a vector store type is created, you cannot change its content type.


-   File upload does not occur until the vector store creation is begun.


-   Source file are not retained in the system â€“ only the vectorized content.
