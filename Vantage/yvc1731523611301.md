Permanent space (perm space) is the maximum amount of storage assigned to a user or database. Because the DBA creates and owns most databases and tables, assign the DBA the majority of space on the system. In **Advanced options** when creating a DBA, the permanent space is pre-populated at 60% with the value in bytes.

-   The combined total of space for all databases and users equals the total amount of disk space available in your VantageCloud Lake system.


-   Permanent space is used for tables, join/hash indexes, stored procedures, and UDFs.


-   Unused permanent space is available to be used as spool or temp space.


-   All permanent space specifications are subtracted from the DBC users.
