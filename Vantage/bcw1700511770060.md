An organization admin can provision the Data copy service on VantageCloud Lake with the help of Teradata support.

Create a support request at [https://support.teradata.com](https://support.teradata.com) to help with the following requirements:

-   Configure **QueryGrid** to connect Data copy between environments.


-   Install the copy manager on the VantageCloud Lake.


-   Create an AWS or Azure [interface endpoint](dvp1707442265467.md) between environments.


-   Install the copy agent on the target environment. This can be either a VantageCloud Lake, VantageCloud Enterprise, or VantageCore environment.

    **QueryGrid** is the supported copy method.


-   Connect environments.


**Notes**:

-   You cannot connect copy manager to a system that is already connected to a different **Data copy manager**.


-   You cannot connect copy manager to more than one system.


See [Enable Data Copy Service](https://docs.teradata.com/access/sources/dita/topic?dita:topicPath=zmv1694773546514.dita&utm_source=console&utm_medium=iph) for detailed instructions on provisioning for non-Lake supported platforms.

## 1. QueryGrid pre-requisites


The following **QueryGrid** configuration needs to be performed before Data copy can be enabled:

1.  Provision **QueryGrid** in your VantageCloud Lake environment.

    From the environment, go to **Manage data** > **QueryGrid**. See [QueryGrid deployment](wrw1640282047881.md).


1.  Create a private link connection for **QueryGrid** to connect VantageCloud Lake to a target Vantage environment or another VantageCloud Lake environment.


1.  Establish a foreign (target) server to perform data copies.

    A foreign server can be a VantageCloud Lake, VantageCloud Enterprise, or VantageCore environment


## 2. Add an environment


When provisioning Data copy for the first time, select an available VantageCloud Lake environment from the menu.

When adding an additional environment, go to **Data copy** > **Connections** > **Connection map** and select **+** to find a data source established in QueryGrid from the menu.

Have your private link endpoint (AWS or Azure) information available to connect an environment.

## 3. Install copy manager


Copy manager is the software package installed on VantageCloud Lake to copy data to and from a target environment.

Select one of the available VantageCloud Lake environments in the **Connection map** that does not show copy manager as installed. In the **Environments details** pane, select **Install Copy manager** from the menu.

## 4. Install copy agent


Copy agent is the software package installed on the target environments VantageCloud Lake, VantageCloud Enterprise, or VantageCore to copy data to and from the VantageCloud Lake source environment that has copy manager installed.

When you connect an environment, you install the copy agent as part of the target connection setup.

**Note:** Teradata support is required to install the Data copy agent software on a VantageCloud Enterprise system.
