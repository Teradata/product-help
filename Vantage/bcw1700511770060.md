Before connecting an environment, the following must be performed to enable Data copy:

-   Install Copy Manager on VantageCloud Lake.


-   Provision an AWS [PrivateLink](dvp1707442265467.md) endpoint on VantageCloud Enterprise (if applicable).


-   Install the Copy Agent on the external Vantage system.

    Currently, only QueryGrid is supported as the copy agent.


See [Enable Data Copy Service](https://docs.teradata.com/access/sources/dita/topic?dita:topicPath=zmv1694773546514.dita) for more information.

## Add an environment


For the first time provisioning Data copy, select an available environment from the menu.

To add an additional environment, select + from **Data copy** > **Connections** > **Connection map** and select a data source established in QueryGrid from the menu.

You will need your AWS PrivateLink endpoint information to connect an environment.

## Install copy manager


Copy manager is the software package installed on VantageCloud Lake to copy data to and from VantageCloud Enterprise or VantageCore.

Select one of the available VantageCloud Lake environments in the **Connection map** that does not show copy manager as installed. In the **Environments details** pane, you can select **Install Copy manager** from the menu.

## Install copy agent


Copy agent is the software package installed on VantageCloud Enterprise or VantageCore to copy data to and from VantageCloud Lake.

When you connect an environment, you install the copy agent as part of the external connection set up.
