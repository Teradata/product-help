## Privileges and Roles


Users are assigned profiles and roles.

-   Profiles define resource parameters for groups of users with similar needs instead of defining the resources for each individual user.

-   Roles give a set of privileges to users with common privilege requirements. For minor privilege differences, you can assign additional privileges directly to individual users.


## Permanent and Spool Space


Permanent and spool space are available based on user needs.

-   Assign permanent storage space to users who create or own databases, tables, and other space-consuming objects.

-   Assign spool space to users who run SQL queries, macros, or stored procedures. The spool specification in a profile limits the amount of available space a profile member can use.

    Spool space requirements depend on the activities of member users. Begin by specifying spool space in bytes according to the following percentages of the total permanent space allocation:

    -   General users: 5%

    -   Update users: 10%

    -   Batch users: 10%

    -   Assistant administrative users: 10%

    -   Business analysts, data analysts, and database programmers: 10%
