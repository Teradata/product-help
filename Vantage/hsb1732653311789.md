ModelOps extracts each variableâ€™s data type (categorical, continuous) from the values provided on dataset template creation and performs basic statistical analysis (mean, median, standard deviation, and so on) on each variable (only continuous). Additionally, ModelOps automatically generates a distribution graph for each one. Histograms are used for the continuous type, and column charts for the categorical type.
