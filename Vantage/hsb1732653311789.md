ModelOps extracts each variableâ€™s data type (categorical, continuous) from the values provided from the dataset template and performs basic statistical analysis (mean, median, standard deviation, and so on) on each variable (only continuous). Additionally, ModelOps generates a distribution graph for each one.

-   Continuous: histogram


-   Categorical: column chart
