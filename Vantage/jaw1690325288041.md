When source data resides in object storage external to VantageCloud Lake, the preferred data loading approach is to use a foreign table to do an INSERT-SELECT into your target table. The steps involved are as follows:

1.  Set up data access privileges. For details, see Native Object Store.


1.  Provide security credentials to read the source files, if required. For details, see Native Object Store.


1.  Define the layout of the source file by following the steps in CREATE FOREIGN TABLE.


1.  Issue an INSERT-SELECT statement to load the data from the source files to the target table in the Object File System. For details, see INSERT-SELECT Statement.


The following are examples of setting up security credentials and a foreign table to read the source files:

Setting up security credentials to read the source files.

Example: Set up an authorization object.

```
CREATE AUTHORIZATION MyAuthObject
USER 'access_key_ID'
PASSWORD 'access_secret_key';

```

Setting up a foreign table to read the source files. Example: Set up a foreign table.

```
CREATE FOREIGN TABLE ForeignTableName
USING ( LOCATION('/connector/external_file_path/) );
```

The following are examples of loading data in different formats:

Example: CSV and Parquet

```
INSERT INTO MyLocalTableName
SELECT Column1, Column2, ColumnN
FROM ForeignTableName;
Example: JSON
```

Example: JSON:

```
INSERT INTO MyLocalTableName
SELECT payload.Column1, payload.Column2,payload.ColumnN 
FROM ForeignTableName
```
