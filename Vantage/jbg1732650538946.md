If you import versions into a model with no existing model versions, you must have a default personal dataset connection associated with the project. See [Add dataset connection](vpe1725389258480.md).

1.  From the environment, select **AI workbench** > **ModelOps** > **Projects** > a project > a model > select **Import model**.


1.  Do the following:

    -   Specify an **External ID**.

        Use **External ID** to identify the model version such as a date or other helpful string.


    -   Add any **Tags** for searching and filtering.


    -   To disable model evaluation and performance monitoring, deselect **Enable model evaluation and performance monitoring**.

        If you leave this enabled, upload the required files:

        -   For Python models

            
                `
                evaluation.py, __init__.py and requirements.txt
                `
              


        -   For R models

            
                `
                evaluation.R
                `
              and requirements.R


    -   To disable feature and drift monitoring, deselect **Enable feature and prediction drift monitoring**.

        If you leave this enabled, upload the required file: data_stats.json.


    -   Upload the required files in **Upload model file**.


    -   Select **Import version**.
