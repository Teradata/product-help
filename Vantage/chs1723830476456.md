After the primary database administrator is created by an organization admin, the database administrator can add and remove subsequent DBAs and users to an environment.

DBAs are responsible for keeping the database at peak performance, and for making sure that the data is secure and protected. DBAs are database users with elevated permissions and perform a variety of administrative tasks, such as:

-   Configure databases, users, roles, and profiles


-   Create tables and views


-   Create stored procedures and user-defined functions


-   Load and export data


-   Use Database Query Logging (DBQL) to track query statement counts and response times, and make refinements to workload groups and scheduling, and so on


-   Learn administrative tools to troubleshoot problems


A DBA can use all the commands in the data definition privileges, the data manipulation privileges, and the data control privileges.
