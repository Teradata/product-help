After the primary database administrator is created by an organization admin, the database administrator can add and remove subsequent DBAs and users to an environment.

DBAs are responsible for keeping the database at peak performance, and for making sure that the data is secure and protected. DBAs are database users with elevated permissions and perform a variety of administrative tasks, such as:

-   Configure databases, users, roles, and profiles


-   Create tables and views


-   Create stored procedures and user-defined functions


-   Load and export data


-   Learn administrative tools to troubleshoot problems


A DBA has all the VantageCloud Lake roles and can assign these roles to users in their environment. A DBA has the ability to create, manage, and delete users and create additional and subordinate DBAs.
