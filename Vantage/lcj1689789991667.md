As a citizen, you can view the list of shares you are subscribed to. Request a subscription by contacting the provider of the share and request to be added.

Use the following conventions to query data from your subscribed datasets:

As an individual subscriber

```
[*ShareName*].[*DatasetName*]
```

For example, a select query looks like

```
SELECT * from SHARE123.DATASET456;
```

As a member of a role

```
SET ROLE [*RoleName*]
SELECT * from [*ShareName*].[*DatasetName*]
```
