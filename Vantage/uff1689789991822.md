**Note:** You must be an organization admin to deploy QueryGrid on VantageCloud Lake.

QueryGrid on VantageCloud Lake has the same functionality as QueryGrid on other platforms. A PrivateLink endpoint is required before connecting QueryGrid on VantageCloud Lake. If provisioning on VantageCloud Enterprise, you must submit a change request before connection. See [Private link change request](fdy1689789992425.md).

**Note:** Target systems must be on QueryGrid 3.0 or later for compatibility with the VantageCloud Lake QueryGrid Manager. See [Upgrade QueryGrid Manager](zbu1689789991346.md).

1.  From the QueryGrid page, select **Enable PrivateLink**.


1.  Enter the AWS cloud accounts for PrivateLink to trust in a comma-seperated list and select **Enable**.


1.  At the prompt, enter the interface endpoint address and select **Provision**.

    You can update the PrivateLink information at a later time in the QueryGrid **Settings** tab.


1.  After deployment, select the option to [add a data source](bhb1689789991794.md).

    If provisioning of PrivateLink or QueryGrid fails, submit a change request to create an incident.
