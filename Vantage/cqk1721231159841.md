You can allow other users and applications to access your VantageCloud Lake environment by selecting either an **Internet** or **Private link** connection.

**Note:** Users can always log into the VantageCloud Lake Console directly, if you've added them to the database and enabled the **Allow UI login** option. See [Manage database users](wxe1659392685092.md).
