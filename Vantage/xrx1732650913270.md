When you open the Models module and select a module in the list, the Lifecycle tab displays the following information:

-   **Lifecycle steps**

    The model version lifecycle steps are shown, along with guidelines to complete the current step and action buttons to go to the next step. Note that lifecycle steps differ between Git and BYOM models.


-   **Model version details**

    The Model version details area displays all the information related to the task you selected to view, including Version ID, Creation Date, Created By, and Status. You can add tags to the model version here by typing in the Tags text area. Specify phrases to help you filter on and search for tasks.


-   **Lifecycle step details**

    As you complete each lifecycle step, the step's details are listed. The most recent step is listed first. Expand or collapse these sections to view or hide the details of a specific step.
