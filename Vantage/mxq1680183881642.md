Single sign-on enables users to sign on using their corporate credentials. As an organization admin, you can connect VantageCloud Lake to your corporate single sign-on.

What to do:

[Configure an identity provider](whf1680184025148.md)

[Create a realm](ruf1680184116601.md) (unless one was created automatically)

[Associate a realm with environments](jbj1680184191443.md)

**Important!** VantageCloud Lake single sign-on does not currently support just-in-time database user provisioning. You must add a new database user to an environment manually. Use the same username that is stored in the identity provider.
