A Network defines the rules that determine which IP addresses to use for QueryGrid communication.

## Add network


Use the ![""](Images/ebt1659745488877.svg) to add a network. Network names and descriptions can use alpha, numeric, and special characters. Blank spaces are not supported in the network name. Select from three different network property options:

-   **Matching rules** use available node addresses for the network connection. You can add or remove multiple matching rules. There are two options for matching rules, **CIDR notation** and **Interface name**.

-   **Load balancer** uses an address or hostname as a network connection instead of individual node IPs.

-   **No ingress** is used when firewalls or other networking rules do not allow bi-directional connectivity.


## Edit network


Use the ![""](Images/zsz1597101912145.svg) to edit a network. In the **Edit network** panel, you can add or remove matching rules or change the network properties to load balancer or no ingress.
