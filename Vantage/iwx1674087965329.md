A Network defines the rules that determine which IP addresses to use for QueryGrid communication.

## Add network


Use ![Plus icon to add item](Images/ebt1659745488877.svg) to add a network. Network names and descriptions can use alphanumeric and special characters. Blank spaces are not supported in the network name. Select from three different network property options:

-   **Matching rules**

    Uses available node addresses for the network connection. You can add or remove multiple matching rules. There are two options for matching rules, **CIDR notation** and **Interface name**.


-   **Load balancer**

    Uses a PrivateLink endpoint address or hostname as a network connection instead of individual node IPs.


-   **No ingress**

    Used when firewalls or other networking rules do not allow bi-directional connectivity.


## Edit network


Use ![Kabob menu icon](Images/zsz1597101912145.svg) to edit a selected network. You can add or remove matching rules or change the network properties to load balancer or no ingress.
