Before you create a realm, you must have at least one [identity provider](whf1680184025148.md) configured.

A realm is a way to group users for authentication purposes. Typically, you have multiple realms. A realm might represent a department, such as Finance, Marketing, or Data Services.

A realm consists of one or more VantageCloud Lake [environments](sbt1640280496980.md). An environment can be in only one realm.

Vantage creates one realm automatically for the first identity provider you configure. That is the **Default** realm, but you can change the name. You associate it with one or more environments. You can create additional realms and associate each one with one or more environments.

From the navigation panel, select **Organization** > **Access Management** > **Realms**.

Use restricted groups from your identity provider to limit access to the realm.

**Example:** You have two groups in your identity provider: Operations and Research. If you add Research as a restricted group, only users in the Research group can access the environments in the realm. You could create another realm for Operations.

**Important!** Include each restricted group in the [identity provider](whf1680184025148.md) **Groups** claim.

**Note**: When you create, or edit or delete, a realm, several minutes might pass before you see the result.
