After Private Link provisioning for the environment is complete, copy the Private Service Connect **Endpoint address** that is generated to use in the Google Cloud Workspace to create a private endpoint.

For general steps, see [Create and manage Private Service Connect interfaces](https://cloud.google.com/vpc/docs/create-manage-private-service-connect-interfaces?hl=en).

1.  From the **Home** page, select an environment.


1.  Select **Settings** ![Settings icon](Images/gkz1722447366517.svg) from the menu and enable the **Private link** option.


1.  In the **Allowlisted accounts**, enter the Google Cloud project number to be allowed to connect to the environment. Separate each account with a comma.

    Select the resource ID connection method, and paste the copied endpoint address as the resource ID.


1.  When provisioning is complete, copy the generated endpoint address and make note of the region that are displayed.

    Select the same region that is shown on the environment's **Overview** tab in VantageCloud Lake.


1.  Configure your GoogleCloud account with the endpoint address as the **Resource ID** and create a private service connect.

    Select the default subnet option for the Virtual Network.


1.  Select **Save**.


After setting up the PrivateLink for GoogleCloud, see [Google Cloud Private Service Connect](https://cloud.google.com/vpc/docs/private-service-connect) for creating endpoints.
