You can organize models within projects and store them in a common model repository. You can also train models, import models, evaluate and compare them for champion model selection, deploy models, and monitor their performance.

ModelOps supports these models:

-   **Git**

    Use the example at [https://github.com/Teradata/modelops-demo-models](https://github.com/teradata/modelops-demo-models) to set up the Git repository structure required by the tmo command-line tool to detect and register models in the repository. This model is supported by Python, R, and SQL.

    **Note:** Git models are not currently supported in VantageCloud Lake.


-   **BYOM**

    Use to train models on a third-party platform or in an external application to evaluate, score, or monitor models. This model is supported by Dataiku, DataRobot, H2O, H2O_DAI, ONNX, PMML, Python, R, and SAS.


-   **Nvidia NIM**

    Use these customized, pre-trained Nvidia models through ModelOps for embedding generation, retrieval-augmented generation (RAG), and LLM-based applications. Nvidia NIM projects support the Nvidia NIM models.
