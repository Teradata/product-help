You can organize models within projects and store them in a common model repository. You can also train models, import models, evaluate and compare them for champion model selection, deploy models, and monitor their performance.

There are two types of models: Git and Bring your own model (BYOM).

-   Git: Use the example at (URL) to set up the Git repository structure required by the tmo command-line tool to detect and register models in the repository. This model is supported by Python, R, and SQL.


-   BYOM: Use to train models on a third-party platform or in an external application to evaluate, score, or monitor models. This model is supported by Python, R, and SAS.
