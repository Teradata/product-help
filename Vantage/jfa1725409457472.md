During each step of the model lifecycle—from training to deployment—a job is executed at the back end to perform the required processing. Use the Jobs option to monitor the jobs, view job logs, and analyze the job lifecycle.

The following job types are executed to complete each step of the model lifecycle:

-   Training: When a model's training starts, a training job is created.


-   Evaluation: To evaluate a trained model, an evaluation job is executed.


-   Approval: The approval process of a model is associated with an approval job.


-   Deployment: When a model is deployed in production, a deployment job is executed.


-   Retirement: A model deployment is retired by executing a retirement job.


The following job types are not part of the model lifecycle but provide supporting information for models and deployments, respectively, for auditing purposes:

-   Compute statistics: Executes to validate and compute statistics for a BYOM model after import.


-   Batch prediction: A scoring job for deployed model version that can be scheduled or manually executed. It is triggered by either cron (scheduled expression) or selecting **Run Now** on the **Deployments Details** > **Jobs** tab.
