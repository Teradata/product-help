You can manage data in a VantageCloud Lake environment several ways:

Moving data:

-   Use Flow to move data once, per a schedule, or continuously from external object storage to Block Storage or Object File System tables in your environment.


-   Create a foreign table and use an INSERT-SELECT statement to move smaller amounts of data from external object storage.


-   Use QueryGrid to replicate data that's in VantageCloud Enterprise or VantageCore on Object File System tables.

    See [Loading Data](https://docs.teradata.com/access/sources/dita/topic?dita:topicPath=zye1681862891537.dita&utm_source=console&utm_medium=iph).


-   Use Teradata Parallel Transporter (TPT) if you have existing processes it supports.


-   Use the ODBC or JDBC Teradata drivers for custom or partner integrations.


-   [Copy data](bgr1694118840100.md) between two VantageCloud Lake environments.


-   Vector store [xref]


You can also use datasets, shared with you by a data sharing provider, to access data already in a VantageCloud Lake environment.

Protecting data:

-   Protect your with schedule backups and disaster recovery plans.
