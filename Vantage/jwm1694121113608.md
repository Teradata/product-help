You can move data into a VantageCloud Lake environment several ways:

-   Use [Flows](auw1640280669500.md) to move data once, per a schedule, or continuously from external object storage to Block Storage or Object File System tables in your environment.


-   Use NOS, create a foreign table, and use an INSERT-SELECT statement to move smaller amounts of data from external object storage.


-   To replicate data that's in VantageCloud Enterprise or VantageCore on Object File System tables, use [QueryGrid](vyx1659391025497.md).


-   If you have existing processes it supports, use Teradata Parallel Transporter (TPT).


-   For custom or partner integrations, use the ODBC or JDBC Teradata drivers.


You can also use [datasets](gds1686247574408.md), shared with you by a [data sharing](jlf1663616946889.md) provider, to access data already in a VantageCloud Lake environment.
