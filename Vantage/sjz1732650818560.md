Select two evaluated model versions to compare.

1.  From the environment, select **AI &ML** > **ModelOps** > **Projects** > the project > **Models** > the model > **Model Versions** tab > **Compare versions**.


1.  Select the metrics required for comparison in the Select comparison fields dialog by hovering on a field in the Available fields list and select ![Add icon](Images/ebt1659745488877.svg).


1.  Add all required fields to the Selected fields list and select **Compare**.

    The Model comparison report displays the values of all the selected fields for the selected model versions. This report is similar to the [Model Evaluation report](vbl1732651027548.md); you can compare the metrics of both the models and decide on a champion model.
