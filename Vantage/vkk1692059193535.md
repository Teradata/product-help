You can create complex SELECT queries using the **Build query** (![""](Images/nsa1692141328702.png)) function. Expand each category to select the query components. Fields are dynamic based on your selections.

Portal content not yet released to link to it - feature scheduled for Sept 23. Should we include any of this information about each category - most of the panel is pretty self-explanitory?

-   Data source: You can select multiple data sources and/or tables (multiple data sources require a join)

-   Columns: Each data source has its own column menu. You must select at least one column. You can customize the query output by adding or removing specific columns. All columns are selected by default.

-   Filters: When adding multiple filters, you must connect the filters using the AND or OR operators.

-   Joins: Dynamic option that is available and required when multiple data sources are selected. You cannot join a table with itself. You cannot create circular joins.

-   Sorts: Select the arrow in the selected column chip to set the column in ascending or descending order.

-   Duplicates: optional.

-   Results: Optional, default is a limit of 50 rows.

-   View query: NOW WHAT? Copy and run how/where?
