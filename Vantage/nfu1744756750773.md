Organization admins can also access the database as single sign-on users by enabling an organization admin realm.

As an organization admin, select from the menu **Home** > **Manage access** > **Identity providers** > **Realms** tab and select the **Organization admin realm** option.

Once the realm is created, sign out and sign back in as the SSO organization admin and enable the **Require organization admins to sign in using SSO** option.

-   Only one organization realm per organization.


-   Organization admins do not have access to environments.


## Remove organization admin realm
