You can access common features from the toolbar, including:

-   SQL editor


-   ask.ai, our AI-powered chatbot


-   Context-specific help


-   User settings


-   Other common tasks


The available options may vary depending on your role, permissions, and environment.

When viewing an environment, the environment switcher is visible. To access a different environment from the one you're in, use the switcher to select a different environment. When you switch the environment, the Console remains on the same page but contains the information for the newly selected environment.
