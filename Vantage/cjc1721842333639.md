The trial lets you access your very own VantageCloud Lake environment with access to all core features. You can self-provision your own environment, add and manage users and compute resources, explore industry-specific use cases, and access more than 100 analytic functions.

Your trial is limited to 30 days or 10,000 units, whichever comes first. A basic trial system uses approximately 168 units per day. The banners on the **Home** page and in the menu display the remaining amounts.

## Trial environment


The Trial is an AWS, XXS 2-instance system with 1TB of store. You can create a single compute group with multiple profiles for resource management.

You can give your colleagues access to your VantageCloud Lake system, by adding them as database users or organization administrators. They can experience the full power of VantageCloud Lake.
