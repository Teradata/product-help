The VantageCloud Lake trial lets you to create a VantageCloud Lake environment with access to all the core features. You can create an environment, add and manage users and compute resources, explore industry-specific use cases, and access more than 100 analytic functions.

## Trial environment


A trial environment consists of the following specifications:

-   An AWS XXSmall 2-instance system with 1 TB of storage

    An instance is an environment in VantageCloud Lake. See [Environments](sbt1640280496980.md).


-   Limited to 30 days or 10,000 units, whichever comes first


-   A basic trial system uses approximately 168 units per day


The banners on the **Home** page and in the menu display the remaining amounts.

You can create a single compute group (allocating compute resources to a specific department or project) with multiple profiles (a scaling policy for compute capacity) for resource management.

You can set up your VantageCloud Lake system by adding database users or organization administrators so they can experience the trial, too.
