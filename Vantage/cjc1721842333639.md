The VantageCloud Lake trial enables you to create your very own VantageCloud Lake environment with access to all the core features. You can self-provision your own environment, add and manage users and compute resources, explore industry-specific use cases, and access more than 100 analytic functions.

## Trial environment


A trial environment consists of the following specifications:

-   An AWS XXSmall 2-instance system with 1 TB of storage


-   Limited to 30 days or 10,000 units, whichever comes first


-   A basic trial system uses approximately 168 units per day


The banners on the **Home** page and in the menu display the remaining amounts.

You can create a single compute group with multiple profiles for resource management.

You can set up your VantageCloud Lake system by adding database users or organization administrators so they can experience the trial, too.
