Service Account authorization type

-   Service account

    This option requires creating a service account user on the target data source. Login credentials are stored in QueryGrid Manager and picked up when you log in to the target data source. A CONNECT THROUGH operation is granted to all initiator users through the service account and run when you log in.

-   Service Account with Authorization Object – DEFINER

    This option requires creation of a service account on target data source. Login credentials are stored in an authorization object on the initiator system in `td_server_db`. The initiator user credentials are used at query time and passed to the target system during connection. A CONNECT THROUGH operation is granted to all initiator users through the service account by QueryGrid.

-   Authorization Object – INVOKER

    This option involves creating an authorization object in each initiating users database which matches the same name as that created during this process in `td_server_db`. At query time the credentials in the authorization object are picked up for the initiating user and passed to target datasource for login.
