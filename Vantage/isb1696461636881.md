Each environment has one primary cluster, which manages query planning and the distribution of work across the environment.

The primary cluster is a group of connected nodes plus block storage.

A primary cluster's instance size (the size of each node) and instance count (the number of nodes) determines its compute resources. See [Create an environment](qiv1640281527006.md).
