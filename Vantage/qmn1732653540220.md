You can view logs of a job to track the job and diagnose errors and warnings that occurred during the processing of the job. Each job also has a lifecycle that includes a number of events from creation to completion. You can view the lifecycle events for each job along with the details of the event.

The Logs tab shows the job logs and events for the selected job event. If the job you selected is in progress (displays a status of In progress), you can select **Stop** to cancel the job.

From the ModelOps menu, select the job > ![kebab menu](Images/zsz1597101912145.svg) > **View Details** > select the **Logs** tab.
