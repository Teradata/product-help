Prediction drift uses feature importance to monitor dataset statistics of the model output to look for deviations. Prior to training a model, features and target must be identified. In the case of an imported model that was trained externally, the data for that model must be identified.

After training a model, ModelOps computes and shows the distribution and statistics for each of the model features and provides a visual overlay of training versus evaluation/scoring statistics.
