Indexing is the process of structuring the unstructured data for efficient search ability. Index settings determine how your vector data is organized for fast and accurate retrieval. Without indexing, every query would require scanning the entire dataset, which would directly impact the performance, scalability, and precision of your vector store.

## What is indexing in a vector store


When you upload documents or access structured data from a table, the information is converted into vector embeddings. These vectors represent the semantic meaning of the original content. An index is built and queries are also converted into vectors.The query vector is compared to the indexed vectors to compile the response.
