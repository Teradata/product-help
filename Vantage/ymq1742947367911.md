Indexing settings determine how your vector data is organized for fast and accurate retrieval. These settings directly impact the performance, scalability, and precision of your vector store.

## What is indexing in a vector store


Indexing is the process of structuring the unstructured data so it can be searched efficiently. Without indexing, every query would require scanning the entire dataset, which is expensive and slow.

When you upload documents or access strutured dta from a table, the information is converted into vector embeddings. These vectors reresent the semntic meaning of the original content. An index is built and queries are also converted into vectors.The query vector is compared to the indexed vectors to compile the response.
