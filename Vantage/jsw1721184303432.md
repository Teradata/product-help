After Private Link provisioning for the environment is complete, copy the **Endpoint address** that is generated to use in the AWS Portal to create a private endpoint.

For general steps, see [Create a service powered by AWS PrivateLink](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/vpc/latest/privatelink/create-endpoint-service.html).

1.  From the **Home** page, select an environment.


1.  Select **Settings** ![Settings icon](Images/gkz1722447366517.svg) from the menu and enable the **Private link** option.


1.  In the **Allowlisted accounts**, enter the **AWS** (with direct connect) account IDs to be allowed to connect to the environment.

    Separate each account with a comma. Select the same region that is shown on the environment's **Overview** tab in VantageCloud Lake.


1.  Configure your AWS account to allow outbound traffic. Contact your AWS administrator for details.

    Select the resource ID connection method, and paste the copied endpoint address as the resource ID.


1.  VantageCloud Lake generates a unique endpoint for you. Copy the generated endpoint address and add it to the AWS private endpoint information in your AWS Console.

    Select the default subnet option for the Virtual Network.


1.  Select **Save**.


After setting up PrivateLink for AWS, see [Connect to an endpoint service](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/vpc/latest/privatelink/create-endpoint-service.html#share-endpoint-service) for creating endpoints.
