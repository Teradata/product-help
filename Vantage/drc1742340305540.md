Once vector store has been enabled for your environment, as a vector store admin, you can create them. From an environment, select **Manage data** in the menu, then **Vector stores**. Select **Create** or ![Add icon, plus sign.](Images/ebt1659745488877.svg) and follow the steps.

A **content-based** vector store uses content provided from a PDF or a table. You can ask questions against the contents of a table, and top matches of relevant rows are returned based on search.

To add users to the vector store, use the menu to access **Manage access** > [Manage database users](wxe1659392685092.md).
