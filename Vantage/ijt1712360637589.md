Available on AWS.

Thales CipherTrust Database Protection (CDP) on VantageCloud Lake offers User Defined Functions (UDFs) that provide high-performance, column-level encryption for structured data residing in databases. Large amounts of sensitive data can be moved in and out of the data stores by efficiently encrypting and decrypting specific columns in databases. CDP can be scaled to support multiple data centers across on-premises, virtual, and public cloud environments..

Before enabling Thales in your environment, you must have the following:

-   A valid license for your CipherTrust Manager server.


-   Your CipherTrust Manager server is setup on AWS and is accessible using a VPC service Endpoint using Private Link.


-   The **Availability Zone ID** of the VantageCloud Lake environment and the AWS **IAM Role**.

From the menu, select **Home** > **User defined functions** > **Third-party applications** tab > **Thales** under the **Available partner solutions** section.

Complete the form and select **Install**. Be sure to acknowledge the licensing agreement.
