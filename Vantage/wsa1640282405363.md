Use the following command-line options to manage streams.

-   Use **tcstreamsec** tcstreamsec to decommission a stream job through the deployer lambda to perform the following actions:

    -   Delete the disposition document

    -   Delete any associated manifest files

    -   Delete the associated EventBridge event rule

    -   Remove the tenant security infrastructure previously applied during stream job deployment

    **Note:** Remove security from assets separately after the stream is decommissioned, either manually or using the **tcstreamsec --remove** option.

-   Use **tcstreamonof** to pause a stream by disabling its poll event, and later resume it by enabling its poll event.

-   Use **tcstreamstat** to report progress of a stream (time of last commit, number of records applied, number of bytes applied, number of error records).

-   Use **tcstreamls** to list all the streams of a tenant.

-   Use **tcstreamcat** to retrieve the disposition document of a stream.
