**Note:** Before you begin, a PrivateLink endpoint must be enabled on both the VantageCloud Lake and VantageCloud Enterprise systems. To enable an AWS endpoint on VantageCloud Enterprise, create a change request through the Enterprise support portal.

When creating a change request for QueryGrid on VantageCloud Enterprise at [https://support.teradata.com](https://support.teradata.com) be sure to have the following information available:

-   Service name of the endpoint service created on the VantageCloud Lake site.

-   Availability zone ID in which the endpoint service was created on the VantageCloud Lake site.


QueryGrid is installed and configured on VantageCloud Lake and the functionality is the same as QueryGrid on VantageCore (on-premisis). To enable QueryGrid, you must enable private link.

1.  From the QueryGrid page, select **Enable Private Link**.

1.  Enter the allowed cloud accounts for private link to trust in a comma-seperated list.

1.  [the wiki says "customer can enable private link - is this a step outside of teradata????]

1.  At the prompt, enter the interface endpoint address.

    You can update the private link information at a later time in the QueryGrid **Settings** tab.

1.  After deployment, you are prompted to add a [data source](znp1640282079399.md).
