QueryGrid is installed and configured on VantageCloud Lake and the functionality is the same as QueryGrid on VantageCore (on-premisis). A PrivateLink endpoint is required before provisioning QueryGrid on VantageCloud Enterprise and must be requested through a change request. See [PrivateLink change request](yml1671157089031.md).

**Note:** If the target system is not a VantageCloud Lake QueryGrid Manager cluster, then the non-Lake clusters must be upgraded to the same version of QueryGrid on the VantageCloud Lake cluster. See [Upgrade VantageCloud Enterprise QueryGrid Manager](wgr1674777759031.md).

1.  From the QueryGrid page, select **Enable PrivateLink**.

1.  Enter the AWS cloud accounts for PrivateLink to trust in a comma-seperated list and select **Enable**.

1.  At the prompt, enter the interface endpoint address and select **Provision**.

    You can update the PrivateLink information at a later time in the QueryGrid **Settings** tab.

1.  After deployment, you are prompted to add a [data source](znp1640282079399.md).

    If provisioning of PrivateLink or QueryGrid fails, submit a change request to create an incident.
