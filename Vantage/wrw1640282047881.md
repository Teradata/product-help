QueryGrid is installed and configured on VantageCloud Lake and the functionality is the same as QueryGrid on VantageCore (on-premisis). A private link endpoint is required before provisioning QueryGrid and must be requested through a change request. See [Private link change request](yml1671157089031.md).

**Note:** If the target data source is not a VantageCloud Lake QueryGrid Manager cluster, then the non-Lake clusters must be upgraded to the latest version of QueryGrid.

1.  From the QueryGrid page, select **Enable Private Link**.

1.  Enter the allowed cloud accounts for private link to trust in a comma-seperated list and select **Enable**.

1.  At the prompt, enter the interface endpoint address and select **Provision**.

    You can update the private link information at a later time in the QueryGrid **Settings** tab.

1.  After deployment, you are prompted to add a [data source](znp1640282079399.md).

    If provisioning of Private Link or QueryGrid fails, submit a change request to create an incident.
