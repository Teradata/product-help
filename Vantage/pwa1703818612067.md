The **Copy plan** tab displays all existing plans.

A copy plan can copy full or partial tables using the WHERE clause. The default setting copies a a full table to the target database.

Things to know:

-   The target user and database must exist before running a copy plan.


-   You must test both the source and target connections separately before selecting objects to copy.


-   Plan names cannot contain blank spaces.


## Selecting objects


You can select individual table settings to change items such as a table name on the target database, map the table to a different database on the target, or validate row count.

When creating a copy plan, you can specify table settings in both the **Objects** and the **Plan settings** steps.

**Note**: Table-specific settings override any table settings made in the plan settings step.

There is no limit to how many objects you can select in a plan.

## Copy method


When selecting the **Copy method** for a plan, if an error stating the foreign server does not exist on the target displays, select **Execute on foreign server**. This scenario could occur when creating a plan using the external system as a source to the VantageCloud Lake system as a target.
