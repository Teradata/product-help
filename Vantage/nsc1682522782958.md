From the navigation panel, select **Consumption** > **Storage**.

As an organization admin, you can see how the environments in your VantageCloud Lake organization consume block storage and object storage.

-   **Block storage** is for data related to time-sensitive workloads or short service-level agreement requests.

-   **Object storage** is for data that supports less time-sensitive analytics, long-running queries, and tables in ETL (extract, transform, and load) processes.


By monitoring storage consumption, you can anticipate additional storage needs.
