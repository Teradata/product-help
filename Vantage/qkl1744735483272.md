You can define the restore job settings when creating a restore job.

These settings can be edited for a specific backup job when you select **Edit** or **Restart** from the job menu.

-   **Original database**

    Restore the backup data to the same database the backup job ran. You have the option to rename the restored objects by adding on a suffix to the object names.


-   **Different database**

    **Note:** This option is available only when you select **Include all objects** in the restore job instead of selecting **Include objects**.

    Select an available database from the menu and enter the credentials to establish a connection.


-   **Cancel job if access rights violations occur**

    The restore job proceeds even when the DUMP access rights violation occurs.

    **Note:** Not applicable with a full system recovery.


-   **Skip job statistics**

    Select this option to collect statistics during a backup or restore job.


-   **Collect job statistics [Edit only]**

    Select this option to collect statistics during a backup or restore job.


-   **Run as copy**

    Select this option to allow the restore job to be re-run automatically if the backup job fails. When this occurs, usually due to deleted objects on the target site, the objects are restored on an internal database with a different database ID. See [Run as copy](csm1744735504461.md).
