You can define a BYOM model with or without importing versions. If you import versions, you must have a default personal connection associated with the project. See [Add dataset connection](vpe1725389258480.md).

1.  From the environment, select **AI workbench** > **ModelOps** > **Projects** > a project > select **Define BYOM**.


1.  Complete the **Basic** tab fields:

    1.  Give the model a meaningful **Name** and **Description**.


    1.  Select the **Format**.

        **Note**: If you import model versions, additional properties need to be set based on the selected format.


    1.  [Optional] **Link to BYOM** to link to the model's (Git or DS [Data Science]) workspace.

        The link is an external reference to this model; it can be a git repository, a link to an online wiki, or any string that provides more information on the model.


1.  [Optional] Select the **Advanced** tab and specify **Configuration** and **Automation** information that will represent the default values to evaluate and score models.

    -   **Configuration**

        Values are passed to the job, in json format.


    -   **Automation**

        Values are used when running the jobs.


1.  Do one of the following:

    -   To save a model without importing model versions, select **Save model** > **Save model**. You can import versions at a later time. See [Import BYOM](nro1732650484867.md) or [Import Python/R model](jbg1732650538946.md).


    -   To save a model that will include imported model versions, select **Save model** > **Save Model & Import Versions**.

        If you didnâ€™t select a default personal dataset connection, you are prompted to select one from the dropdown then **Continue**.


1.  Set the properties based on the selected format.

    Deselecting **Enable model evaluation** disables model version evaluation, meaning if you don't import an evaluation file, the model cannot be evaluated, only deployed.

    For properties information, see [Import BYOM](nro1732650484867.md) or [Import Python/R model](jbg1732650538946.md).


1.  Select **Import version**.
