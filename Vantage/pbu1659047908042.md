The Consumption page provides visibility into compute and storage utilization. The page shows the consumed units for the primary and compute clusters, and for the storage. You can see your committed and consumed units, how much each organization is using each month, as well as the total units for the environment.

VantageCloud Lake uses an industry standard, consumption-based model using units as the measurement metric. Units are consumed when VantageCloud Lake compute resources are running and available to perform workloads. You can control when compute resources are running or not, allowing for cost flexibility.
