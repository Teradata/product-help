The **Consumption** page provides visibility into compute and storage utilization.

You can see your committed units, and units consumed by your whole organization, an environment, or a compute group. You can see units consumed by an environment's primary cluster and compute clusters. Units are consumed when compute resources are active and available to do work, whether or not they are actually doing work.

**Instance size** and **Instance count** affect the unit consumption rate of an [environment's](sbt1640280496980.md) primary cluster. **Size** and **Instance count** affect the unit consumption rate of compute clusters. You can scale in and out to increase or decrease the performance of compute clusters, in compute groups, and change the consumption rate. You can also control when compute groups are active.

Storage is measured and charged in terabytes. The **Storage** tab provides visibility into committed and consumed block and Object File System storage.
