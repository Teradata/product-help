The Consumption page provides visibility into compute and storage utilization. The page shows the consumed units for the primary and compute clusters, and for the storage. You can see your committed and consumed units, how much each organization and compute group is using each month, as well as the total units for the environment.

You can scale in and out to increase or decrease performance on both the primarty and compute clusters. Changes to instance size and count impact the unit consumption rate on primary cluster. Changes to cluster size impact the unit consumption rate on compute clusters.

VantageCloud Lake uses an industry standard, consumption-based model using units as the measurement metric. Units are consumed when VantageCloud Lake compute resources are running and available to perform workloads. You can control when compute resources are running or not, allowing for cost flexibility.

Storage is measured and charged in terabytes. The Storage tab provides visibility to the committed storage size of Native Disk Storage and Object File System, and the actual provisioned usage of Native Disk Storage and Object File System utilization.
