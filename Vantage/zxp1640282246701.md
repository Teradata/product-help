## **Bridges**


[Bridges](wne1674087932617.md) are systems containing a subset of data source nodes or non-data source nodes used to provide connectivity between data sources systems that do not have direct network connectivity.

## **Networks**


A [network](iwx1674087965329.md) defines the rules that determine which IP addresses to use for QueryGrid communication. Rules can be defined using Classless Inter-Domain Routing (CIDR) notation or by matching interface names. Networks are referenced by links and there is an initiating network and target network for each hop.

-   A hop is the transfer of data between two directly connected data sources or bridge systems. The number of hops is based on the number of bridges.


## **Communication policies**


[Communication policies](zap1674087994421.md) control how data flows between QueryGrid-connected systems.

## **User and role mappings**


[User and role mappings](hmn1674088306575.md) connect end users with defined role privileges (access rights or permissions) when using QueryGrid.

## **Private link**


A [Private link](eyz1674088497701.md) is a secure connection using a virtual IP address to communicate between data sources.
