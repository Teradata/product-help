An organization admin creates the first DBA (dbadmin) and grants space and privileges to users before proceeding with the database implementation. The DBA can then create databases, tables, users, and other objects in the space it owns.

Additional DBAs can be created by existing DBAs.

**Tip:** For larger systems, create multiple DBA users to share database administration duties.

1.  From an environment, select **Manage access** > **Users**.


1.  Enter the root (DBC user) password.


1.  Select **Create** > **Create database admin**.


1.  Enter the credentials for the new DBA.

    When creating the password, create a simple temporary password that follows the default system password controls and site policy. Each user will be prompted to change the temporary password to a permanent, private password when they sign in.


1.  [Optional] Use the **Advanced options** section to specify the amount of [Permanent space](yvc1731523611301.md)and [Character set](hnk1731523638342.md) for the environment. System defaults are applied when you donâ€™t enter values for the space and characters.


1.  Select **Create**.

    You can optionally select **Select SQL** to view the assigned privileges before creating the database admin user. This is a view-only screen.

    **Note:** The DBA privileges are preset. To add or modify privileges, find and edit the new DBA listed on the [Manage database users](wxe1659392685092.md) page.
