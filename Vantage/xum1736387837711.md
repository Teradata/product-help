As an organization admin, you can select an Industry data model for your VantageCloud Lake system.

Installing an industry data model provides a blueprint with structures (tables and columns) along with definitions and industry-specific metadata. The data model administrator can create the fully commented tables and columns in the database.

**Important:** Once you install a data model, it cannot be changed. The selected data model can be installed by an organization admin or a DBA in an environment that has the Lake+ or Lake Premium package.

The DBA must have the data model admin role.

## Organization admin


If there are environments in your organization that have the Lake+ or Lake Premium package, a banner is displayed on the Home page stating that an industry data model can be installed.

Go to **Manage access** > **Organization admins** and assign the data model admin role to the DBA who will install the data model.

**Reminder!** Only one data model can be selected and cannot be changed or removed after confirming selection.

The data model admin can review and select one of ten different industry models:

-   Communications


-   Financial services


-   Healthcare


-   Life sciences


-   Manufacturing


-   Media and entertainment


-   Retail


-   Transportation and logistics


-   Travel and hospitality


-   Utilities


## Assign the data model admin


Once an industry data model has been selected for the organization, a data model admin must be assigned in the environment that has the Lake+ or Lake Premium support package to install the model.

From the environment, go to **Manage access** > **Users** and assign the data model admin role to the DBA who will decide and install the data model to the environment.

The dashboard view for the data model admin will display a message that the data model is ready to install.

Select **Install**.

Due to the large number of tables and columns, the install may take up to 30 minutes to complete. You can continue to use the console during the installation process.

Once the installation is complete, you can open the editor and browse the tables and columns added with the data model.
