Create dataset connections to ensure projects, dataset templates, and model versions you are training use data from a specific database. You can create multiple *personal dataset connections*, including a default, to ensure your datasets and models use the same database. Use default personal dataset connections when creating dataset templates and training models; they are not required but are recommended for use with projects. Default personal dataset connections are required to import model versions.

ModelOps admin users can create *service dataset connections* for use when deploying models. It's a good idea to create these before prior to deploying a model as you will be prompted to specify a service dataset connection.

Your ModelOps admin provides the credentials you need to create a dataset connection.
