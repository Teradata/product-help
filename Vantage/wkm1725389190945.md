Connections allow projects, dataset templates, and model versions you are training to use data from a specific database. You can create multiple *personal connections*, including a default, to ensure your datasets and models use the same database. Use default personal connections when creating dataset templates and training models; they are not required but are recommended for use with projects.

Admin users can create *service connections* for use when deploying models. It's a good idea to create these before prior to deploying a model as you will be prompted to specify a service connection.
