**Note:** Git models are not currently supported in VantageCloud Lake.

The **Models** tab shows model types, languages used by the models, number of deployments, number of alerts generated, and number of active/archived models.

You can define a BYOM model or perform a real-time Git pull. ModelOps checks for and retrieves Git code updates at a regular interval.
