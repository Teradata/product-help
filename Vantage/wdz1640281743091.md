To use a compute group, a user needs access to it directly or through a role.

A user can have access to multiple compute groups and choose a compute group for each workload.

When creating a user, select the compute groups they can access directly and their roles.

## Compute Groups


For each compute group to which you give the user direct access, select Admin or View.

An Admin user can create new profiles for the compute group and suspend and resume the compute group even if a schedule is defined for it.

A View user can only run workloads on the compute group.

## Roles


Completed queries viewer can view sessions of other users.

Current queries admin can end database sessions.

Streams admin can create and manage their own streams.

User admin can create and manage users.

Data scientist can create UDFs.
