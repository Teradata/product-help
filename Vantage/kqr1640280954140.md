You can restore all of a backup plan's objects, or selected objects, from a restore point using the **Restore** menu option. You can access the restore menu option by selecting a job listed on the **Restore points** tab or the **Restore jobs** tab.

You can also perform the following during a restore:

-   A full system restore point (full restore) on same-site.


-   A cross-site restore for disaster recovery purposes.


You need the following privileges to restore data:

-   The organization admin role.


-   Restore access rights on all databases and tables in the environment.


-   CREATE, ALTER, and DROP permissions on the target database.


On the **Restore jobs** page, you can view the job's status, any errors, and re-run the restore job if it fails.
