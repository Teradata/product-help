From the navigation panel, select **Environments** > the environment > **Data protection** > **Restore points**.

You can restore all a backup plan's objects, or just selected objects, from a restore point.

In addition to organization admin privileges, you need:

-   Restore access rights on all databases and tables in the environment


-   CREATE, ALTER, and DROP permissions on the target database


On the **Restore jobs** page, you can view the job's status, any errors, and rerun the job if it fails.
