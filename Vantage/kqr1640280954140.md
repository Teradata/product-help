You can restore all or selected objects from a full or partial backup.

To restore a backup, you must have the following privileges:

-   Org admin rights to create and restore backup jobs


-   Restore access rights on all databases and tables on the system


-   Ability to grant CREATE, ALTER, and DROP permissions to the td-user


From the **Data protection** page, select **Restore points** and locate the backup to restore. Follow the prompts to restore data.

**Restore jobs** lists the current and past restore jobs. You can view the status, any errors, and rerun a failed job.

To save a backup's restore point indefinitely, you can protect it. The number of saved backups at one time increases consumption costs and is limited to 4 protected backups per backup job.
