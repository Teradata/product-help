A profile is a scaling policy for a compute group. You can create multiple profiles for a compute group using different times of day or different workloads. Without profiles, all queries run on the primary cluster.

You must have ORG_ADMIN privileges to create a profile.

The following profile configuration values affect cost:

**Size**: The instance size of a compute group profile and number of nodes available for that profile.

-   XSmall = 1 node

-   Small = 2 nodes

-   Medium = 4 nodes

-   Large = 8 nodes

-   XLarge= 16 nodes

-   XXLarge = 64 nodes


**Cool-down time**: The minutes to run the system after a query completes before initiating any further queries or going into hibernation.

**Auto-scale**: Adjusts the number of compute groups based on workload. When enabled, you can specify the minimum and maximum number of clusters to activate.

**Min count**: Multiplies this number of nodes. For example, if instance **Size** is 16 nodes and **Min count** is 2, the profile has 32 nodes.

**Max count**: Specifies the number of secondary compute clusters that auto scaling can enable.

**Schedule**: Specifies when a profile is active. Without a schedule, a profile is always active.

**Suspend**: Suspends a profile. If you create a suspended profile, it stays inactive until you resume the profile, regardless of a schedule. If you suspend an active profile, queries continue to run until the cool-down time ends.
