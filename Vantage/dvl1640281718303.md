Instance size is the number of nodes and the minutes to run a typical query on a compute cluster that has this profile.

MIN_COMPUTE_COUNT multiplies this number of nodes. For example, if Instance size is 16 nodes and MIN_COMPUTE_COUNT is 2, the account has 32 nodes.

MAX_COMPUTE_COUNT specifies the number of secondary compute clusters that autoscaling can bring up.
