A compute profile is a scaling policy for a compute group. You can create multiple compute profiles for different times of the day or week for different workloads. For example, you could create one with more compute capacity for the day and one with less compute capacity for the night.

A compute group must have at least one compute profile. Otherwise, all queries run on the primary cluster.

You must have ORG_ADMIN privileges to create a profile.

Compute profile configuration affects your costs:

**Size**: Number of nodes in each compute cluster.

-   XSmall = 1 node

-   Small = 2 nodes

-   Medium = 4 nodes

-   Large = 8 nodes

-   XLarge= 16 nodes

-   XXLarge = 64 nodes


**Cool-down time**: The minutes to run the system after a query completes before initiating any further queries or going into hibernation.

**Auto-scale**: Adjusts the number of active compute clusters based on workload. If you enable it, specify the minimum and maximum number of clusters to activate. If you disable it, specify a static number of clusters.

**Schedule**: Specifies when a profile is active. Without a schedule, a profile is always active.

**Suspend**: Suspends a profile. If you create a suspended profile, it stays inactive until you resume it, regardless of a schedule. If you suspend an active profile, queries continue to run until the cool-down time ends.
