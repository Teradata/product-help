A profile is a scaling policy for compute clusters that are the same size in the same compute group. The following profile configuration values affect cost:

**Instance size**, the number of nodes and the minutes to run a typical query on a compute cluster that has this profile.

**Elasticity (Enable compute workers)** creates compute workers. See [Compute workers](lyi1662583368110.md).

**Auto-scale**, which adjusts the number of secondary compute clusters based on workload.

**Min count** multiplies this number of nodes. For example, if **Instance size** is 16 nodes and **Min count** is 2, the account has 32 nodes.

**Max count** specifies the number of secondary compute clusters that autoscaling can bring up.

**Schedule** specifies when the profile is active.
