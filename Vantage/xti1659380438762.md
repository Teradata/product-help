Use Editor to create, edit, and run SQL commands on your databases. Use SQL to browse object stores.

There are implicit and explicit queries. Implicit queries run in the background. Explicit queries run in the foreground.

Results of a query are shown in the Results pane below the Editor pane. Download results in CSV or JSON format, up to 10,000 table rows.

Editor scripts and queries are saved to your browser. If you clear the browser history or use another browser, you will not see your scripts.
