Use Editor to do the following:

-   Create, edit, and run SQL commands and scripts on your databases.

-   Browse object stores.

-   Run SQL commands leveraging NOS to load CSV, JSON, and Parquet data from an external object store into a local table.

-   Download results in CSV or JSON format, up to 10,000 table rows.

-   Run featured use cases that access preloaded datasets. To access use cases, select Use cases on the home page. Each use case contains instructions.


There are implicit and explicit queries. Implicit queries run in the background. Explicit queries run in the foreground.

**Note:** Editor scripts and queries are saved to your browser. If you clear the browser history or use another browser, you will not see your scripts.
