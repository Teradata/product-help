When you select a deployment to view details, the view depends on the deployment type. If a deployment is set to publish only, scheduling is disabled.

Each deployment type shows the following details:

-   Deployment ID and Engine type used for the deployment


-   Model name and version ID


-   Jobs for batch prediction and scoring (not available for publish only deployments)


-   Drifts such as Feature drift, prediction drift and performance drift


-   **Note:** RESTful deployments are not supported in VantageCloud Lake.

    Testing information (Docker RESTful deployments only) - Use the current model endpoint, or send live request from the editor to view the prediction
