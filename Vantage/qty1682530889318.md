You manage compute consumption two ways.

## Primary cluster


As an organization admin, when you [create an environment](qiv1640281527006.md), you select the **Instance size**, which is the size of each node in the primary cluster. You also select an **Instance count**, the number of nodes.

The units consumed by the **Instance size** multiplied by the **Instance count** are the units the primary cluster consumes per hour.

Units consumed by **Instance size**:

## Compute groups


As an organization admin or compute group admin, when you [manage compute group profiles](dvl1640281718303.md), you select a **Size**, which is the number of nodes in each compute cluster. You also select an **Instance count**, the number of compute clusters.

The units consumed by that **Size** multiplied by the **Instance count** are the units the compute group consumes per hour while the profile is active.

You can set compute clusters to scale automatically, from a minimum to a maximum instance count. If you do, the units consumed per hour varies.
