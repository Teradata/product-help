Copy this information from your identity provider portal:

-   The **Provider URL** to which authentication requests are sent

-   Your **Client ID** and **Client secret**

-   The **Authorization scheme**

-   The **Scopes** (groups of claims) your identity provider requires


VantageCloud Lake single sign-on requires the **openid** scope. Your identity provider might require others.

You need the claims from your identity provider to map to these VantageCloud Lake claims:

-   groups

-   given_name

-   display_name

-   family_name

-   email

-   username


**Important!** Once you enter the **Provider URL**, a Redirect URI appears. You must add this **Redirect URI** to your identity provider configuration in the identity provider portal.
