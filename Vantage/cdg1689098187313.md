## Teradata QueryGrid Manager


Software that enables definition, administration, and monitoring of Teradata QueryGrid.

## Data source


System containing one or more nodes that share the same software platform, such as Teradata system nodes.

## Bridge


A system containing a subset of data source nodes or non-data source nodes used to provide connectivity between data sources systems that do not have direct network connectivity.

## Fabric


One or more data source nodes, spanning multiple systems, that run a compatible version of Teradata QueryGrid tdqg-fabric software. Only links that involve the Teradata Connector are supported.

## Connector


Adapter software that enables data type mapping, conversion, and communication with other connectors in the same Teradata QueryGrid Fabric. The initiating connector is the connector you interact with to start the query and the target connector is the connector that gets triggered on the remote side to do most of the processing of the query. The following connectors are supported:

-   VantageCloud Lake on AWS:

    Teradata-to-Teradata

    -   VantageCloud Enterprise on AWS (requires a PrivateLink change request)

    -   VantageCore (on-premises)

    Teradata-to-Apache Hive

    -   Amazon EMR

    Teradata-to-Apache Spark

    -   Amazon EMR

    Generic JDBC

    -   Other JDBC-compatible query engines (such as Amazon Redshift)**

        Refer to the QueryGrid Installation and User Guide for driver node requirements.

-   VantageCloud Lake on Azure:

    Teradata-to-Teradata

    -   VantageCloud Enterprise on Azure (requires a PrivateLink change request)

    Teradata-to-Teradata

    -   VantageCore (on-premises)


## Link


Named configuration that specifies which connectors can communicate with each other and defines rules of data transfer.
