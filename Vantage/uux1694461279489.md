A disaster recovery plan includes the full environment.

From the **Disaster recovery** pane, select **Create**.

A plan can be run on a schedule or manually run. To manually control the backup schedule, disable the **Enable** > **Schedule** option. This can be changed at a later time.

The **Retention policy** is the number of successful backups to save. Each saved backup is called a restore point and are saved on both the source and target environments. Retained restore points incur storage costs.
