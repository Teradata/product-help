The ModelOps Dashboard is where you create and access projects. A *project* consists of models, datasets, and other resources you use to train, evaluate and deploy a model in your environment.

From the ModelOps dashboard, select ![kebab menu](Images/zsz1597101912145.svg) > **View Git details** for a project to check for connectivity errors.

From the toolbar, select **Your account** ![Person icon](Images/mci1652327190262.svg) > **Account settings** or **Session details** to access ModelOps [account settings](jue1725407850414.md) or [session details](xfm1725407885906.md), respectively.

**Note:** These settings differ from your VantageCloud Lake account settings.
