The Dashboard represents the ModelOps Home screen where you create and access projects.

A *project* consists of models, datasets, and other resources you use to train, evaluate and deploy a model across multiple environments.

From the environment, select **AI workbench** > **ModelOps** > **Projects** >![kebab menu](Images/zsz1597101912145.svg) > **View GIT details** for a project to check for errors.

From the toolbar, select **Your account** ![Person icon](Images/mci1652327190262.svg) > **Account settings** or **Session details** to access [account settings](jue1725407850414.md) or [session details](xfm1725407885906.md), respectively.
