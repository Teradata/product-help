A default personal dataset connection is required to train models. Teradata recommends creating a default personal dataset connection prior to training a model. See [Add dataset connection](vpe1725389258480.md).

You must assign a [dataset template](frd1725409311264.md) and [dataset](xfu1732652871944.md).

1.  From the environment, select **AI workbench** > **ModelOps** > **Projects** > the project > **Models** > select a model version > **Train model**.

    Select a personal dataset connection from the drop-down. If a default personal dataset connection has not been created, you will be prompted to create it.

    1.  Complete the fields and save the dataset connection.

        Once created, the dataset connection displays in the menu.


    1.  Select **Continue**.


1.  Set properties on the **Basic** and **Advanced** tabs.

    1.  On the **Basic** tab, select the **Dataset template** and **Dataset**. The ModelOps UI will reflect all user-defined **Hyper parameters** (defined in code); you can modify the values here before starting the training job.

        **Note:** Once you train a model with specify hyperparameter values, they cannot be modified. To modify the values, you must train a new model with different values.


    1.  On the **Advanced** tab, specify the **Docker image** version, and the **Resource template** details.

        Identify a predefined set of resources, including CPU and memory, which are the properties of the container created to run the task in.

        -   Select a **Template** size from the drop-down.


        -   Set any of the following properties:

            **Memory**: Specifies the allocated RAM memory for the container. Must be an integer followed by the unit (m for megabytes or g for gigabytes).

            **CPU**: Specifies the allocated CPU units (cores) for the container, can be an integer or decimal number. Accepts m as the unit for milicores.

            **GPU** (visible when **Custom** is selected): Specifies the allocated GPU units for the container, can be an integer or decimal number. Accepts m as the unit for milicores.


1.  Select **Train model**.

    **Training job details** shows the Logs information. You can **Stop** (pause) the progress.

    **Logs** lists logs and events for the selected job.

    The **Events** section on the **Logs** tab shows the event progress.

    **Properties** lists all properties related to the selected job such as job ID, dataset ID, and hyper parameters.


1.  Select ![Close icon](Images/teg1680569591203.svg) when the training progress completes.

    The List of model versions shows details for each model version.
