From **Data protection**, select ![""](Images/ebt1659745488877.svg) on the **Plans** page to create a new backup plan.

In **Retention policy**, enter the number of backups you want to store and maintain. Each plan has its own retention policy and schedule.

When creating a new backup plan, be sure to fill out the **Settings**, **Objects**, and **Schedule** tabs before saving. When not specified, defaults are **All objects** and a **Daily** backup schedule at midnight UTC.
