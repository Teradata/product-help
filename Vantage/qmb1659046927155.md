You can create a backup plan that includes all the objects in a database or selected objects.

Under **Retention policy**, enter the number of restore points to retain. Restore points are backups you want to store and maintain. Each plan has its own retention policy and schedule.

To create a backup plan that is only manually run, disable the **Enable** checkbox under the **Availability** section.

When creating a new backup plan, be sure to fill out the **Settings**, **Objects**, and **Schedule** tabs before saving. When not specified, defaults are **All objects** and a **Daily** backup schedule at midnight UTC.

You can manually start or stop a backup from the **Plans** page.
