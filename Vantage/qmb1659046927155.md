A backup plan can includes all the objects in a database or selected objects.

**Retention policy** is the number of restore points to retain. Restore points are the completed backup jobs. The number of retained restore points incur storage costs.

To prevent jobs from running according to the schedule, ensure that **Enable** is not selected.

Before saving the backup plan, review all three tabs. By default, all database objects are included and, if the plan is enabled, backup jobs run daily.

You can manually start or stop a backup jobs from the **Plans** page.
