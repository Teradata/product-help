From the navigation panel, select **Environments** > the environment > **Data protection** > **Plans**.

A backup plan can include all the objects in a database or just the objects you select.

The **Retention policy** is the number of backups to save. Each saved backup is called a restore point. Retained restore points incur storage costs.

To prevent jobs from running according to the schedule, ensure that **Enable** is not selected.

Before saving the backup plan, review all three tabs. By default, all database objects are included and, if the plan is enabled, backup jobs run daily.

In addition to, or instead of, relying on scheduled backup jobs, you can [run a backup job manually](tyu1695326821997.md).
