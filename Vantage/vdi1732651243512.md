ModelOps supports partitioned (micro) modeling where an individual model is trained on a specific partition of the data for each model version. For example, if you have a dataset of product sales and you want to create a predictive model for future sales for every product, you can use micro modeling.

A model can have thousands of model partitions though it is represented as one model version in the UI. A micro model is recognized by the fact that it generates a partition artifact after the training.

1.  From the environment, select **AI workbench** > **ModelOps** > **Projects** > the project > **Models** > a model > **Model Versions** tab > a micro model.


1.  Expand the Training details section to view the model version training details.

    Select the **View training details for model partitions** link under Training artifacts to view model partition details.


1.  **Select hyper parameters** you want to display in the Partitions list.
