An organization admin creates an environment. This includes configuring the primary cluster.

**Note:** Instance size, count, and region combined with actual units consumed affect cost.

1.  From the **Environments** page, select **Create**.

1.  Complete **Site configuration** with the following considerations:

    -   **Environment name**: Up to 64 characters

    -   **Package**: Lake or Lake+

    -   **Region**: Available regions were determined during the sales process.

    -   **Instance size**: Instance size refers to the number of units available for consumption. This helps you optimize costs based on compute and resource needs.

        XSmall = **Lake** 5 units : **Lake+** 6 units

        Small = **Lake** 10 units : **Lake+** 12 units

        Medium = **Lake** 20 units : **Lake+** 24 units

        Large = **Lake** 30 units : **Lake+** 36 units

        XLarge= **Lake** 40 units : **Lake+** 48 units

        XXLarge = **Lake** 60 units : **Lake+** 72 units

    -   **Instance count**: 2 to 64 nodes.

    -   **Instance storage**: 1 to 24 TB of storage per node.

1.  Complete **Connectivity Options** with the following considerations:

    -   **IP address access list**: Specify the IP address, or range of addresses, to allow access to the environment.

        1 IP address per line or in a comma-seperated list.

        Use CIDR format for a range. For example, 192.168.2.0/24 specifies all IP addresses in the range: 192.168.2.0 to 192.168.2.255.

    -   **Username** The default environment username is DBC. This DBC user is the DBA (group administrator) of the environment and has root access to the database.

        Additional database users with different roles and permissions are created at a later time.

    -   **DBC password**: Set the password with the following requirements:

        Between 8 and 64 characters.

        Both alpha and special characters.

        No dictionary words.


**Note:** After creating an environment, you cannot change the **Site Configuration** or **Connectivity Options**. You can change how you connect to your environment, using **Private link** or **Internet** and associated Compute Group settings or create a change request to have the environment deleted.
