An organization admin creates an environment.

From the **Environments** page, select **Create**.

The default environment **Username** is DBC. The DBC user is the DBA (group administrator) of the environment and has root access to the database. Later you can create additional [database users](wxe1659392685092.md) with different roles and permissions.

**Note:** To have the environment deleted, submit a change request.

The region, [primary cluster](isb1696461636881.md) size, and actual [units consumed](onj1682104977691.md) affect cost. As you change environment settings, [Consumption estimates](aow1703107228725.md) automatically shows your projected use and any overage.

## Primary cluster configuration


-   **Instance size** is the size of each node in the [primary cluster](nmr1658424425362.md). This size determines the number of [units consumed](tdv1682522711429.md) per instance per hour. Select the best size to optimize costs for your compute and resource needs.


-   **Instance count**: The number of nodes in the primary cluster (2 to 64).


-   **Instance storage**: 1 to 72 TB of storage per node.


## Advanced options


The primary cluster has a default number of AMPs per instance, which varies by instance type. Use this option to define the number of AMPs per instance and configure storage encryption.

**Important**: Keep **Use defaults** enabled unless you have contacted Teradata Services for your workload-specific configuration.
