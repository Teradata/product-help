An organization admin creates an environment.

From the **Environments** page, select **Create**.

The default environment **Username** is DBC. The DBC user is the DBA (group administrator) of the environment and has root access to the database. Later you can create additional [database users](wxe1659392685092.md) with different roles and permissions.

**Note:** To have the environment deleted, submit a change request.

The region, [primary cluster](isb1696461636881.md) size, and actual [units consumed](onj1682104977691.md) affect cost. As you change environment settings, [Consumption estimates](aow1703107228725.md) automatically shows your projected use and any overage.

## Primary cluster configuration


-   **Instance size** is the size of each node in the [primary cluster](nmr1658424425362.md). This size determines the number of [units consumed](tdv1682522711429.md) per instance per hour. Select the best size to optimize costs for your compute and resource needs.


-   **Instance count**: The number of nodes in the primary cluster (2 to 64).


-   **Instance storage**: 1 to 72 TB of storage per node.


## Advanced options


To define additional optional settings disable **Use defaults**. When using the default option, the environment is deployed with the selected configurations (zone, instance size, and so on) anddata is protected with the platform managed encryption keys.

**Important**: Keep **Use defaults** enabled unless you have contacted Teradata Services for your workload-specific configuration.

**Availability zone (AWS only)**

Select an **Availability zone** if a specific location within the default region is preferred.

If a zone is not available, an error will display when you select **Create Environment**.

**AMPs per instance (AWS andAzure only)**

The primary cluster has a default number of AMPs per instance, which varies by instance type. Use this option to define the number of AMPs per instance.

**Storage type (AWS only)**

Default storage type is **General purpose SSD**. If your instance count is greater than 9 nodes, the system defaults to **Provisioned IOPS SSD**. If you have less than 10 nodes, you can select to switch to the **Provisioned IOPS SSD**, but not the reverse. This will affect your pricing and is reflected in the **Consumption estimates** information. Changing to the larger storage option does not incur any downtime.

**Storage encryption (AWS only)**

**Note**: Applying a customer managed encryption key works only for new environments at provisioning. Once applied, the storage encryption type cannot be changed on that environment.

If you do not yet have an AWS Customer Managed Encryption Key (CMEK) established, see [Creating a Customer Managed Encryption Key for AWS](https://docs.teradata.com/access/sources/dita/topic?dita:topicPath=qly1704828971494.dita).

If Teradata is managing your data, keep **Managed by Teradata** selected. If you select Customer managed, enter your AWS CMEK ID.
