An organization admin can create an account.

**Note:** Instance size, count, and region selections combined with actual units consumed affect cost. After you create an account, you cannot change the **General** or **Additional Options** or delete the account. You can change how you connect to your account, using **Private link** or **Internet** and associated Compute Group settings.

1.  Under **Accounts**, select **View All Accounts**, then select **Create**.

1.  Complete **General** and **Additional Options** with the following considerations:

    -   Account name: Up to 64 characters

    -   Instance count: 2 to 64 (number of nodes)

    -   Instance size:

        XSmall=r5d.2xlarge

        Small=r5d.4xlarge

        Medium=r5d.8xlarge

        Large=r5d.12xlarge

        XLarge=r5d.16xlarge

        XXLarge=r5d.24xlarge

    -   Instance storage: 1 to 24 TB per instance

    -   DBC password: Default account username is DBC. Set the password with the following considerations:

        Between 8 and 64 characters

        Both alpha and special characters

        No dictionary words

    -   Platform: AWS

    -   Region: Available region list was predetermined during the sales process.

    -   Compute workers: false (default) or true

        Optional compute resources for compute-intensive work

    -   IP address access: Allow any IP address (public access) or provide a list of IP addresses to have access with the following considerations:

        1 IP address per line

        Use CIDR format for a range. For example, 192.168.2.0/24 specifies all IP addresses in the range: 192.168.2.0 to 192.168.2.255.
