**Note:** Some options may be pre-selected or unavailable in a VantageCloud Lake trial environment.

As an organization admin, you can create environments once your organization is established in VantageCloud Lake.

From the menu, select **Home** > **Create** > **Create environment**.

**Important!** The region, [primary cluster](isb1696461636881.md) size, and actual [units consumed](onj1682104977691.md) affect cost. As you change environment settings, the [Consumption estimates](aow1703107228725.md) panel automatically updates projected use and any overage with the changes.

## Environment


**Region** Select an available region closest to your location for best performance.

**Availability zone (AWS only)**

You can select an **Availability zone** within your region where you have other applications running to improve performance and cost efficiency. Selecting the region closest to your physical location provides the best performance.

**Package** Select the support package for the environment.

-   Standard Supports fewer than 10 nodes, single node cliques, same environment backup and restore.


-   Lake Premier 24x7 cloud support.

    Supports up to 128 nodes, single- and multi-node cliques, Private Link connectivity, same environment backup and restore.


-   Lake+ Premier 24x7 Priority cloud support + industry data models.

    Supports up to 128 nodes, single- and multi-node cliques, Private Link connectivity, multiple environments backup and restore.


**Key management** You can choose your preferred storage encryption:

-   **Managed by Teradata** This is the default option which maintains support for your platform-managed encryption key.


-   **Customer managed** You create and manage the customer managed encryption keys (CMEK).

    -   Applying a customer managed encryption key works only for new environments at provisioning. Once applied, the storage encryption type cannot be changed on that environment.


    -   It is your responsibility to update the CMEK policy when new services are introduced.


    -   Do not modify the key policy in VantageCloud Lake. Update in the cloud provider's key management system.


    -   Select one of the following cloud providers to learn more about creating your symmetric software encryption key to use as the CMEK.

## Manage access


Dynamic option. Displays when your organization already has established identity providers and realms. Select a realm to enable the single sign-on feature.

## Primary cluster configuration


-   **Standard** is a general-purpose option providing balanced performance for a wide range of workloads.


-   **High I/O** is available in select regions and is best for heavy workloads and is network optimized. High I/O consumes more units.


-   **Instance size** – The size of each node in the [primary cluster](nmr1658424425362.md). This size determines the number of [units consumed](tdv1682522711429.md) per instance per hour. Select the best size to optimize costs for your compute and resource needs.


-   **Instance count** – The number of nodes in the primary cluster (2 to 128).


-   **Total storage in TB** – Enter the total storage for the primary cluster. This value gets evenly divided across the nodes.


## Database credentials


The default environment's **Username** is DBC. The DBC user is the DBA (group administrator) of the environment and has root access to the database. You can create additional [database users](wxe1659392685092.md) and with different roles and permissions later.

Create a unique password for DBC, following the password requirements.

**Important!** Safeguard your credentials. You will need the root password for creating the first database administrator.

## Advanced options


To define the advanced optional settings, disable **Use defaults**. When using the default option, data is protected with the platform-managed encryption keys.

**Important!** Keep **Use defaults** enabled unless you have contacted Teradata Services for your workload-specific configuration.

**AMPs per instance**

The primary cluster has a default number of AMPs per instance, which varies by instance type. Use this option to define the number of AMPs per instance.

**Storage type**

Default storage type is **General purpose SSD**. If your instance count is greater than 9 nodes, the system defaults to **Provisioned IOPS SSD** on the primary cluster. If you have less than 10 nodes, you can select to switch to the **Provisioned IOPS SSD**, but not the reverse. This will affect your pricing and is reflected in the **Consumption estimates** information. **Provisioned IOPS SSD** is required for multi-node cliques.

Changing to the larger storage option does not incur any downtime.

## Create


When the information is complete, select **Create environment**.

When the new environment is created, it appears in the environment list with the status **Running**.
