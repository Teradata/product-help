An organization admin creates an environment.

From the **Environments** page, select **Create**.

The region, [primary cluster](isb1696461636881.md) size, and actual [units consumed](onj1682104977691.md) affect cost.

Primary cluster settings:

-   **Instance size** is the size of each node in the [primary cluster](nmr1658424425362.md). This size determines the number of [units consumed](tdv1682522711429.md) per instance per hour. Select the best size to optimize costs for your compute and resource needs.

    |Instance size|Lake units|Lake+ units|
    |--------------|-----------|------------|
    |XSmall|2.0|2.4|
    |Small|4.0|4.8|
    |Medium|7.0|8.4|
    |Large|10.0|12.0|
    |XLarge|13.0|15.6|
    |XXLarge|20.0|24.0|
    |XXXL (Azure only)|27.0|32.4|


-   **Instance count**: The number of nodes in the primary cluster (2 to 64).


-   **Instance storage**: 1 to 72 TB of storage per node.


The default environment **Username** is DBC. The DBC user is the DBA (group administrator) of the environment and has root access to the database. Later you can create additional [database users](wxe1659392685092.md) with different roles and permissions.

**Note:** To have the environment deleted, submit a change request.
