An organization admin creates an environment.

**Note:** Instance size, count, and region selections combined with actual units consumed affect cost.

1.  Under **Environments**, select **View All Environment**, then select **Create**.

1.  Complete **General** and **Additional Options** with the following considerations:

    -   **Environment name**: Up to 64 characters

    -   **Instance count**: 2 to 64 (number of nodes)

    -   **Instance size**:

        XSmall=r5d.2xlarge

        Small=r5d.4xlarge

        Medium=r5d.8xlarge

        Large=r5d.12xlarge

        XLarge=r5d.16xlarge

        XXLarge=r5d.24xlarge

    -   **Instance storage**: 1 to 24 TB per instance

    -   **DBC password**: Default environment username is DBC. Set the password with the following considerations:

        Between 8 and 64 characters

        Both alpha and special characters

        No dictionary words

    -   **Platform**: AWS

    -   **Region**: Available region list was predetermined during the sales process.

    -   **IP address access**: Allow any IP address (public access) or provide a list of IP addresses to have access with the following considerations:

        1 IP address per line

        Use CIDR format for a range. For example, 192.168.2.0/24 specifies all IP addresses in the range: 192.168.2.0 to 192.168.2.255.


**Note:** After creating an environment, you cannot change the **General** or **Additional Options** or delete the environment. You can change how you connect to your environment, using **Private link** or **Internet** and associated Compute Group settings.
