# Create


Use this tab to view current Accounts (databases) or to create new ones.

The tile for each account shows its configuration and status.

-   Account size refers to the instance type of r5.12xl and the number of nodes:

    Small=2 nodes, Medium=4 nodes, Large=8 nodes, and so on

-   DBC password: 8-64 characters, both alpha and special characters, no dictionary words

-   Enter 1 IP address per line in CIDR format.

    Use CIDR format for a range (for example, 192.168.2.0/24 specifies all IP addresses in the range: 192.168.2.0 to 192.168.2.255).
