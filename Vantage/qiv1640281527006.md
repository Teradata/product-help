An organization admin creates an environment.

**Note:** Region, instance size, instance count, and actual units consumed affect cost.

1.  From the **Environments** page, select **Create**.

1.  Complete **Site Configuration** with the following considerations:

    -   **Environment name**: Up to 64 characters.

    -   **Package**: Lake or Lake+.

    -   **Region**: Available regions are determined during the sales process.

    -   **Instance size**: The size of each node in the primary cluster. This size determines the number of units available for consumption per instance per hour. Select the best size, to optimize costs, for your compute and resource needs.

        **Lake**

        XSmall = 5 units

        Small = 10 units

        Medium = 20 units

        Large = 30 units

        XLarge = 40 units

        XXLarge = 60 units

        XXXLarge = 80 units

        **Lake+**

        XSmall = 6 units

        Small = 12 units

        Medium = 24 units

        Large = 36 units

        XLarge = 48 units

        XXLarge = 72 units

        XXXLarge = 96 units

    -   **Instance count**: The number of nodes in the primary cluster (2 to 64).

    -   **Instance storage**: 1 to 24 TB of storage per node.

1.  Complete **Connectivity Options** with the following considerations:

    -   **IP address access list**: Specify the IP address, or range of addresses, to allow access to the environment.

    -   **Username**: The default environment username is DBC. The DBC user is the DBA (group administrator) of the environment and has root access to the database.

        Additional database users with different roles and permissions are created at a later time.

    -   **Password**

        From 8 to 64 characters.

        Alpha and special characters allowed.

        No dictionary words.


**Note:** After creating an environment, you cannot change the **Site Configuration** or **Connectivity Options**. You can change how you connect to your environment, using **Private link** or **Internet**, and associated compute group settings. Submit a change request to have the environment deleted.
