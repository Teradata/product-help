An organization admin manages users.

## Permanent space


Permanent space is available based on user needs. Assign permanent storage space to users who create or own databases, tables, and other space-consuming objects.

## Allow UI login


This allows a user to access databases using an application outside of VantageCloud Lake.

## Compute groups


Assign users access to [compute groups](mqu1640280532737.md).

An Admin user can create compute profiles for a compute group and suspend and resume the compute group even if a schedule is defined for it.

A View user can only run workloads on the compute group.

## Roles


Roles give a set of privileges to users with common privilege requirements.

## Revoke token


Revokes the JSON Web Token (JWT).
