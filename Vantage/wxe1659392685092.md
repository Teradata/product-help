## Create users


To create a user, select **Users** from **Environments**, and do the following:

Select !["](Images/ebt1659745488877.svg) in the toolbar, then enter the user name, amount of permanent storage, and a temporary password. These fields are required.

Note the following when creating users:

-   Permanent storage space should be assigned to users who create or own databases, tables and other space-consuming objects.

-   **Allow UI Login** allows a user to access databases using an application outside of VantageCloud Lake.

-   **Roles** assign a set of privileges to a user. Best practice is to use roles to assign privileges to a user.

-   **Compute Groups** options are **Admin** and **View**. Admin allows the user to manually suspend and resume compute groups even when a schedule is defined. Selecting Admin automatically selects View too.


## Update users


To update a user, select **Users** from **Environments**, and select ![""](Images/zsz1597101912145.svg) next to the user name. Options are:

-   **Edit**: To update the user name, permanent space allocation, UI access, group and role.

    **Delete**: To remove the user. You are prompted to confirm the deletion.

    **Note:** You can also select the check box next to the user name, and select ![""](Images/bqw1546981365016.svg).

-   **Revoke token**: To revoke the JSON Web Token (JWT).
