As an organization admin or dba you can manage database users. Most VantageCloud Lake users are Vantage console users and database users.

## Create user


From the menu, select **Home** > the environment > **Manage access** > **Users**.

## Allow UI sign in


Allow a user to access the VantageCloud Lake console.

## Database settings


**Permanent space** is available based on user needs. Assign permanent storage space to users who create or own databases, tables, and other space-consuming objects. See [Permanent space](yvc1731523611301.md).

**Character set** can be set to the default character set or you can specify Unicode or Latin for a specific user. See [Choose a character set](hnk1731523638342.md).

## Compute groups tab


Assign users access to [compute groups](mqu1640280532737.md).

An Admin user can create compute profiles for a compute group and suspend and resume the compute group even if a schedule is defined for it.

A Member can only run workloads on the compute group.

## Roles tab


Roles give a defined set of privileges to users with common privilege requirements.

## Revoke token


Found in an individual user's menu. Revokes the JSON Web Token (JWT). For example, after a user has left the organization, the administrator can immediately revoke any active sessions that are running in the console for that user.

From the **Users** page, find the user under **Username** then select ![Kebab menu.](Images/kbt1547502809538.png) > **Revoke token**.
