## Create users


To create a user, select **Users** from **Accounts**, and do the following:

1.  Select !["](Images/ebt1659745488877.svg) in the toolbar.

1.  Enter the user name, amount of permanent storage, and a temporary password. These fields are required.

    **Note:** Assign permanent storage space to users who create or own databases, tables and other space-consuming objects.

1.  (Optional) Select **Allow UI Login** to allow the user to access databases using an application outside of VantageCloud Lake.

1.  (Optional) Select **Compute Groups**, then select the compute group for the user by selecting **Admin** or **View**. Admin allows the user to manually suspend and resume compute groups even when a schedule is defined. Selecting Admin automatically selects View too.

1.  (Optional) Select **Roles**, and then select the roles for the user. Best practice is to use roles to assign privileges to a user.


## Update users

    **Note:** You can also select the check box next to the user name, and select ![""](Images/bqw1546981365016.svg).

-   **Revoke token**: To revoke the JSON Web Token (JWT).
