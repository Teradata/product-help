As a citizen, you can view the list of shares you are subscribed to. Request a subscription by contacting the provider of the share and request to be added.

Use the following conventions to query data from your subscribed datasets:

-   As an individual subscriber:


        
    ```
    

        
        [
      *ShareName*
        ].[
      *DatasetName*
        ]
      
    

        
    ```
    

    

      For example, a select query looks like


    
        ```sql
    

        
        SELECT * from SHARE123.DATASET456;
      
    

        
    ```
    

    

  
-   As a member of a role:


        
    ```
    

        
        SET ROLE [
      *RoleName*
        ]
    SELECT * from [
      *ShareName*
        ].[
      *DatasetName*
        ]
      
    

        
    ```
    

    

  
Use one the following options to query data from your subscribed datasets:

-   **Copy SQL** to copy the SQL query and use it in a external SQL client.


-   **Open in editor** to use the query in the **SQL editor**.
