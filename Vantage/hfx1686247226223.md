As a citizen, you can view the list of shares and request to subscribe to them.

Use the following conventions to query data from your subscribed datasets:

As an individual subscriber

```
 [*ShareName*].[*DatasetName*]
```

For example, a select query looks like

```
SELECT * FROM SHARE123.DATASET456;
```

As a member of a role

```
 SET ROLE [*RoleName*]
[*ShareName*].[*DatasetName*]
```
