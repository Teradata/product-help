When you create a realm, you associate it with one or more Vantage [environments](sbt1640280496980.md). Or when you create or edit an environment, you can associate it with a realm.

Go to **Environments** > the environment > **Identity providers & realms**.

To add users to an environment, go to **Environments** > the environment > **Users**.

**Important!** VantageCloud Lake single sign-on does not currently support just-in-time database user provisioning. You must add a new database user to an environment manually. Use the same username thatâ€™s stored in the identity provider.
