When you create a realm, you associate it with one or more Vantage [environments](sbt1640280496980.md).

Or you can create a realm, then later create one or more environments. When you create or edit an environment, you can associate it with a realm.

Go to **Environments**, then the environment, then **Identity providers & realms**.

To add users to an environment, go to **Environments**, then the environment, then **Users**.

**Important!** VantageCloud Lake single sign-on does not currently support just-in-time database user provisioning. You must add a new database user to an environment manually. Use the same username thatâ€™s stored in the identity provider.
