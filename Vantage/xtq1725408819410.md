**Note:** Git models are not currently supported in VantageCloud Lake only.

You can view commit history for Git-based models of the selected project. The commit history provides a timeline for the model's code changes.

From the ModelOps dashboard, select the project > **Models** > the Git model > expand a row to review model version details impacted by a commit.
