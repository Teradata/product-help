Compute groups have the following capabilities:

-   You can create them for specific departments, applications, or projects, then segregate processing, monitoring, reporting, and billing by department, application, or project.

-   They are ideal for periodic, predictable, special-purpose tasks, such as month-end processing, exploration, and projects.

-   With no service interruption, they can be started to accommodate bigger workloads and stopped when no longer needed (to lower costs).

-   They can directly access large tables in the Object File System.

-   They hold intermediate data in memory or in internal drives.

-   They store no permanent data.

-   They are 100% fault-isolated from system-wide failures.

-   They are independently upgradeable to newer versions of software without disrupting the rest of the system.
