Compute groups are separate compute clusters of BYNET-connected nodes independent of the Primary Operational Group. They perform compute-intensive query steps that free the Primary Operational Group to perform session management, parsing engine functions, and tactical or other short-term functions.

Compute group characteristics include the following:

-   Provide additional resources dynamically according to workload.

-   Optionally specialized for departments or work types.

-   Extend and automatically scale up compute power.

-   Read large tables in TSS.

-   Hold intermediate data in memory or in internal drives.

-   Store no permanent data.

-   100% fault-isolated from system-wide failures.

-   Independently upgradable to newer versions of software without disrupting the rest of the system.


On an analytic compute group, at most 10 queries can run concurrently on the nodesâ€”half as many as on a standard compute group. The APPLY table operator always runs on an analytic compute group. Teradata recommends using an analytic compute group when running an external UDF. With fewer concurrent queries, the external UDF has less competition for resources.
