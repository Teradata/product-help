Compute groups are separate clusters of connected nodes that are independent of the primary cluster. Use compute groups to perform compute-intensive query steps to free the primary cluster to perform more immediate functions. Compute groups must contain a [profile](dvl1640281718303.md).

To create a compute group, you must have ORG_ADMIN privileges.

Compute groups have the the following capabilities:

-   They can directly access large tables in Object File System.

-   They hold intermediate data in memory or in internal drives.

-   They store no permanent data.

-   They are 100% fault-isolated from system-wide failures.

-   They enable you to independently upgradeable to newer versions of software without disrupting the rest of the system.

-   With no service interruption, they can be started to accommodate bigger workloads and stopped when no longer needed (to lower costs).

-   You can create them for specific departments, applications, or projects, and then segregate processing, monitoring, reporting, and billing by department, application, or project.

-   You can associate each department with its own group of compute clusters, which lets you isolate each department's work and costs.

-   They are ideal for periodic, predictable, special-purpose tasks, such as month-end processing, exploration, and projects.
