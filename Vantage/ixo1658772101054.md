Compute Groups are separate compute clusters of BYNET-connected nodes independent of the Primary Operational Group. They perform compute-intensive query steps that free the Primary Operational Group to perform session management, parsing engine functions, and tactical or other short-term functions.

Compute Group characteristics include the following:

-   Optionally specialized for departments or work types.

-   Extend and automatically scale up compute power.

-   Read large tables in TSS.

-   Hold intermediate data in memory or in internal drives.

-   Store no permanent data.

-   100% fault-isolated from system-wide failures.

-   Independently upgradable to newer versions of software without disrupting the rest of the system.
