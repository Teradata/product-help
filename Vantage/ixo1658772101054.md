Compute groups are separate compute clusters of BYNET-connected nodes independent of the Primary cluster. They perform compute-intensive query steps that free the Primary cluster to perform session management, parsing engine functions, and tactical or other short-term functions.

Compute groups have these characteristics:

-   They can read large tables in Object File System.

-   They hold intermediate data in memory or in internal drives.

-   They store no permanent data.

-   They are 100% fault-isolated from system-wide failures.

-   They enable you to independently upgradable to newer versions of software without disrupting the rest of the system.

-   With no service interruption, they can be started to accommodate bigger workloads and stopped when no longer needed (to lower costs).

-   You can create them for specific departments, applications, or projects, and then segregate processing, monitoring, reporting, and billing by department, application, or project.

-   You can associate each department with its own group of compute clusters, which lets you isolate each department's work and costs.

-   They are ideal for periodic, predictable, special-purpose tasks, such as month-end processing, exploration, and projects.
