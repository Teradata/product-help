As a [database user](wxe1659392685092.md), you can inspect an environment's queries for efficiency:

-   With appropriate query privileges, view details about current or completed queries for all users. This includes implicit queries, which run in the background.

-   Drill down into a query's steps.

-   With the query admin privilege, cancel current queries for any user.

-   Copy or download SQL statements.

-   Compare the performance of alternative code to develop more-efficient processing strategies.


From the navigation panel, select **Environments** > the environment > **Queries**.
