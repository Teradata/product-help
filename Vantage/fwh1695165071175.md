From the Data protection's **Restore points** page, you can **Protect** or **Restore** a backup.

When you create a backup plan, you establish a **retention policy**, which is the number of backups to save. Each saved backup is called a restore point.

**Note:** All retained restore points incur storage costs.

When you protect a restore point, it is saved indefinitely, regardless of the retention policy.
