When you create a backup plan, you establish a **retention policy**, which is the number of backups to save. Each saved backup is called a **restore point**, data saved at a point in time defined by the backup plan.

You can protect or restore a backup. Protecting a restore point saves the backup job indefinitely, regardless of the retention policy. The number of saved backups at one time increases costs and is limited to 4 protected backups per backup job. When restoring from a backup, you have options to restore all objects or selected objects.
