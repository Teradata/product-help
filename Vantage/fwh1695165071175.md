From the navigation panel, select **Environments** > the environment > **Data protection** > **Restore points**.

When you create a backup plan, you establish a **retention policy**, which is the number of backups to save. Each saved backup is called a restore point.

All retained restore points incur storage costs.

You can protect a restore point. This saves it indefinitely, regardless of the retention policy.
