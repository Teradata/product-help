Vector search goes beyond simple keyword or synonym matching by understanding user intent and provides context-based answer. The search settings determine your vector store retrieves and ranks results. Tuning these settings ensures your search is both effective and relevant to your search.

Key algorithms that are utilized in the search process:

-   Vector distance uses cosine similarity and euclidean distance to determine the distance between each vector, individually, and returns the vector embedding closest to the query. Using vector distance is best for smaller datasets since it works slower with more accurate results.


-   K-means clusters the vectors based on distance, calculating the average of these vectors to form a centroid. The search then identifies the nearest centroid and returns vectors within the area. K-means has a high performance on large datasets. It processes faster than vector distance and relies on averages.


-   HSNW uses a graph-based index that balances speed and accuracy. Good for real-time applications.
