Flow is a streaming service that loads JSON, CSV, and Parquet data from an S3-compatible object store to VantageCloud Lake.

Flow infers the source data schema and creates target tables in VantageCloud Lake.

You can submit units of work that run for hours or days without risk of rollback due to client or network failure.
