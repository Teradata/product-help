**Block storage** is accessible to an environment’s primary cluster. You consume it by provisioning it to an environment. As an organization admin, when you create an environment, you indicate the number of terabytes in the **Instance storage** field.

**Object storage** is accessible to an environment’s compute clusters. [How is it consumed? What does a user do to consume it? This user might be a DB user in a Compute Group.]

When the contract term ends, unused terabytes of block and object storage do not roll over to the next term. If you consume all available terabytes before the term ends, you pay for additional consumed terabyes on a month-to-month basis.
