Use Editor to browse database objects, and create, edit, run, and save SQL commands and scripts. Editor has preloaded analytics functions for querying data and a simple point-and-click query builder.

You can also run featured [use cases](iww1680797117120.md) that access preloaded datasets. Each use case contains instructions.

From the navigation panel, select **Editor**.
