Write, run, modify, import, and export SQL statements and scripts.

When you run a single SQL statement, the Editor returns the results and output. When you run a script, the Editor returns a result for each statement, and output. Selecting a single statement in a script and selecting **Run** runs only that statement.

Results can be sorted, filtered, and downloaded in JSON or CSV format.

Output shows the number of rows returned for the SQL statements.
