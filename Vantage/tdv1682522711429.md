From the navigation panel, select **Consumption** > **Compute**.

As an organization admin, you can see how your VantageCloud Lake organization consumes compute resources. See consumption in hourly, daily, weekly, monthly, or quarterly increments, for a time period, all the way down to the compute group profile level.

This helps you do the following:

-   Direct costs to departments.

-   Efficiently use committed compute resources.

-   Control costs for on-demand compute resources.


[Add examples that show what different time increments can help them do?]
