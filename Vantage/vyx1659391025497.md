Use QueryGrid to transfer data between one or more data sources.

QueryGrid in VantageCloud Lake supports only Teradata-to-Teradata connectivity between:

-   VantageCloud Lake and VantageCloud Enterprise on AWS.

    A PrivateLink endpoint is required. Request an endpoint through a change request on the Vantage support portal.

-   VantageCloud Lake and VantageCore (on-premises). QueryGrid is configurable through self-service and does not require Teradata consulting engagement.

-   Queries can only be initiated from VantageCloud Lake, but data transfers are bi-directional.


No other QueryGrid connectors are supported with VantageCloud Lake.
