QueryGrid on Vantage supports the following connectivity types:

**Note:** To setup and configure the required PrivateLink endpoint on VantageCloud Enterprise, open a [private link change request](yml1671157089031.md) on the VantageCloud Enterprise customer support portal.

-   Teradata-to-Teradata between VantageCloud Lake and VantageCloud Enterprise on AWS.

-   Teradata-to-Teradata between VantageCloud Lake and VantageCore (on-premises).

-   Teradata-to-Apache Hive between VantageCloud Lake and Amazon EMR.

-   Teradata-to-Apache Spark between VantageCloud Lake and Amazon EMR.

-   Between VantageCloud Lake and other data sources (such as Amazon Redshift) through the Generic JDBC connector.

    Refer to the QueryGrid Installation and User Guide for driver node requirements.


These connections are supported and are configurable through self-service and do not require a Teradata consulting engagement.

Query initiation is only possible from VantageCloud Lake, but transfers are bi-directional.

## Components


-   Teradata QueryGrid Manager

    Software installed on a dedicated physical machine (TMS or server) or VM that enables definition, administration, and monitoring of Teradata QueryGrid.

-   Data Source

    System containing one or more data source nodes that share the same software platform, such as Teradata system nodes.

-   Bridge

    A system containing a subset of data source nodes or non-data source nodes used to provide connectivity between data sources systems that do not have direct network connectivity.

-   Fabric

    One or more data source nodes, spanning multiple systems, that run a compatible version of Teradata QueryGrid tdqg-fabric software listening on the same port. Only links that involve the Teradata Connector are supported.

-   Connector

    Adapter software for a data source that enables data type mapping, conversion, and communication with other connectors in the same Teradata QueryGrid Fabric. The initiating connector is the connector you interact with to start the query and the target connector is the connector that then gets triggered on the remote side to do most of the processing of the query. The following connectors are supported:

    -   Teradata

    -   Apache Spark

    -   Apache Hive

    -   Generic JDBC Connector

-   Link

    Named configuration that specifies which connectors can communicate with each other and defines rules of data transfer.


## Configurable entities


-   Network

    A Network defines the rules that determine which IP addresses to use for QueryGrid communication. Rules can be defined using Classless Inter-Domain Routing (CIDR) notation or by matching interface names. Networks are referenced by links and there is an initiating network and target network for each hop. The network options are:

    -   **Load balancer**: A load balancer network simplifies the network setup when the a system connects to a single Private link. When a Private link is used in conjunction with a bridge system, it sits directly behind the load balancer.

    -   **No ingress**: Use no ingress when firewalls or other networking rules do not allow bi-directional connectivity.

-   Hops

    A hop is the transfer of data between two directly connected data sources or bridge systems. The number of hops is based on the number of bridges.

-   Communication policy

    Communication policies control how data flows between QueryGrid-connected systems.
