QueryGrid Teradata-to-Teradata is the only supported connectivity between the following:

-   VantageCloud Lake and VantageCloud Enterprise on AWS.

    **Note:** This requires a Private Link endpoint. To set up Private Link, make a change request on the VantageCloud Enterprise customer support portal.

-   VantageCloud Lake and VantageCore (on-premises).

    These connections are supported and are configurable through self-service and do not require a Teradata consulting engagement.

-   No other QueryGrid connectors are supported.

    Query initiation is only possible from VantageCloud Lake, but transfers are bi-directional.


QueryGrid on VantageCloud Lake contains the following components:

-   Teradata QueryGrid Manager

    Software installed on a dedicated physical machine (TMS or server) or VM that enables definition, administration, and monitoring of Teradata QueryGrid.

-   Data Source

    System containing one or more data source nodes that share the same software platform, such as Teradata system nodes.

-   Bridge

    A system containing a subset of data source nodes or non-data source nodes used to provide connectivity between data sources systems that do not have direct network connectivity.

-   Fabric

    One or more data source nodes, spanning multiple systems, that run a compatible version of Teradata QueryGrid tdqg-fabric software listening on the same port. Only links that involve the Teradata Connector are supported.

-   Connector

    Adapter software for a data source that enables data type mapping, conversion, and communication with other connectors in the same Teradata QueryGrid Fabric. The initiating connector is the connector you interact with to start the query and the target connector is the connector that then gets triggered on the remote side to do most of the processing of the query. The following connectors are supported:

    -   Teradata

    -   Spark SQL

    -   Hive

-   Link

    Named configuration that specifies which connectors can communicate with each other and defines rules of data transfer.


QueryGrid contains the following configurable entities:

-   Network

    A Network defines the rules that determine which IP addresses to use for QueryGrid communication. Rules can be defined using Classless Inter-Domain Routing (CIDR) notation or by matching interface names. Networks are referenced by links and there is an initiating network and target network for each hop. The network options are:

    -   **Load balancer**: Used to simplify the PrivateLink setup to a single PrivateLink. PrivateLink is used in conjunction with a bridge system directly behind the load balancer.

    -   **No ingress**: Use no ingress when firewalls or other networking rules do not allow bi-directional connectivity.

-   Hops

    A hop is the transfer of data between two directly connected data source or bridge systems. The number of hops is based on the number of bridges.

-   Communication policy

    Communication policies control how data flows between QueryGrid-connected systems.

-   Load balancer network

    A load balancer network simplifies the setup when the on-prem system connects to a single PrivateLink. When PrivateLink is used in conjunction with a bridge system it sits directly behind the load balancer.
