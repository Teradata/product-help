During each step of the model lifecycleâ€”from training to deploymentâ€”ModelOps runs a job to perform the required processing. The following types of jobs are run to complete each step of the model lifecycle:

-   **Training**

    Executes the user-defined files to create a trained model that will become a new model version.


-   **Evaluation**

    Runs a performance evaluation of the model version.


-   **Approval**/**Rejection**

    Allows approving or rejecting the model and provides the reasons for future reference.


-   **Deployment**

    Deploys a model version in production.


-   **Retirement**

    Retires the model version from production.


The following job types are not part of the model lifecycle but provide supporting information for models and deployments, respectively, for auditing purposes:

-   **Import**

    Uploads and stores the files of the BYOM model.


-   **Compute statistics**

    Executes to validate and compute statistics for a BYOM model after import. These statistics will be used for evaluation in next step.


-   **Batch Prediction**

    A scoring job for deployed model version that can be scheduled or manually executed. It is triggered by cron (scheduled expression) or by selecting **Run Now** on the **Deployments Details** > **Jobs** tab.


You can view logs of a job to track the job and diagnose errors and warnings that occurred during the processing of the job. Each job also has a lifecycle that includes events from creation to completion.
