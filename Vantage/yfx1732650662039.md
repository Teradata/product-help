During each step of the model lifecycleâ€”from training to deploymentâ€”a job is executed at the back end to perform the required processing. The following types of jobs are executed to complete each step of the model lifecycle:

-   **Training**: Creates a training job when a model's training starts.


-   **Evaluation**: Executes an evaluation job to evaluate a trained model.


-   **Approval**: The approval process of a model is associated with an approval job.


-   **Deployment**: Executes a deployment job when a model is deployed in production.


-   **Retirement**: Executes a retirement job when a model deployment is retired.


The following job types are not part of the model lifecycle but provide supporting information for models and deployments, respectively, for auditing purposes:

-   **Compute Statistics**: Executes to validate and compute statistics for a BYOM model after import. These statistics will be used for evaluation in next step.


-   **Batch Prediction**: A scoring job for deployed model version that can be scheduled or manually executed. It is triggered by either cron (scheduled expression) or selecting **Run Now** on the **Deployments Details** > **Jobs** tab.


You can view logs of a job to track the job and diagnose errors and warnings that occurred during the processing of the job. Each job also has a lifecycle that includes events from creation to completion.
