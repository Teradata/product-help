## Share


Share is an entity defined in the data-sharing service. It contains datasets and subscribers, which define what data is shared and with whom respectively. It also has a provider, who is the SQLE user owning the Share and providing access to the data.

## Dataset


A dataset is a reference to either a table or a view in SQLE to which the provider of the Share has access with grant authority. You can configure the access rights for each dataset to provide SELECT, INSERT, UPDATE or DELETE (or a combination of these) access to the subscribers of the Share.

When access is changed, it is immediately applied to all subscribers of the share. A dataset must have a unique name inside of a Share, which the subscribers identify and use to query the dataset.

## Subscriber


A subscriber is a reference to either a user or role in SQLE. The provider can add it to a Share and once added, it immediately gets access to all datasets of the Share.

## Provider


A provider is a reference to a user in SQLE who creates and owns the Share. A provider's primary responsibility (in the context of data-sharing) is to manage their own Shares, which includes adding/removing datasets and subscribers to each Share and deleting the Share when no longer needed.
