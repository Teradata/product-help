1.  From the ModelOps dashboard, select the project > **Models** > the model version > **Alert configuration** tab > **Create rule**.


1.  Give the alert a meaningful **Name**, **Summary**, and **Description**.


1.  Add an **Expression** by defining threshold values for metrics to generate alerts.

    The expression uses PromQL syntax: [https://prometheus.io/docs/prometheus/latest/querying/basics/](https://prometheus.io/docs/prometheus/latest/querying/basics/)

    Select **Reset to default** to reset to the default expression.


1.  Select a time duration from the **Occurs for** drop-down or create a custom value.

    The duration is the time window that the condition of the expression must be met more than once to fire the alert. The following example is based on a duration of 10 minutes and expr is temperature > 100º:

    -   If at 0:00 t=101º and 8:32 t=103º, the alert is fired (because the duration between then is less that 10:00).


    -   If at 0:00 t=101º and then at 11:32 t=103º, the alert is not fired.


1.  Select **Save**.
