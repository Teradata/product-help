Model drift represents the concept of a model degrading in performance over time due to changes in the underlying dataset or concepts. Monitoring model drift involves the ability to surface this performance information to the end-user and configure alerts so that they can take actions to reduce the business impact of this drift.

ModelOps monitors three types of drift: [feature](xxa1732651110275.md), [prediction](etr1732651148787.md), and [performance](jrp1732651191166.md).

As you view the result of each drift type, you can hover on a data point in the graph. A tooltip displays listing the information related to the value at that point including date, metric value, its comparison with the previous value and the evaluation Job ID.

You can also use the **Select metrics** option to add fields and generate a custom view of metrics in tile and graph format.
