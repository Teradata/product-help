Deployment of QueryGrid inside VantageCloud Lake is fully automated, however connecting to VantageCloud Lake through QueryGrid requires the setup of a dedicated AWS PrivateLink connection. The following information provides steps on setting up or requesting a PrivateLink endpoint, depending on the connectivity type.

## VantageCloud Enterprise


A PrivateLink endpoint must be enabled on the VantageCloud Enterprise systems. To enable an AWS PrivateLink endpoint on VantageCloud Enterprise, create a change request through the Enterprise support portal.

1.  Go to [https://support.teradata.com](https://support.teradata.com).

1.  Select **Request a Change**.

1.  Create a change request.

1.  In the request details, enter `"Purpose: Request for creating VantageCloud Enterprise PrivateLink endpoint for QueryGrid"` and provide the following information:

    -   VantageCloud Enterprise siteID.

    -   Service name of the endpoint service created on the VantageCloud Lake site.

    -   Availability zone ID in which the endpoint service was created on the VantageCloud Lake site.


## VantageCore, EMR, or Generic JDBC


1.  Sign into your Amazon VPC console.

1.  Confirm with your AWS administrator that you have the necessary IAM permissions.

1.  Use the endpoint service name created on VantageCloud Lake to create the interface endpoint.


## Multiple endpoints


For any subsequent PrivateLink endpoints created to connect systems to VantageCloud Lake, create a load balancer network for each PrivateLink endpoint. Provide the PrivateLink service endpoint address as the load balancer network value.
