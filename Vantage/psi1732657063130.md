After creating a project with models, dataset templates and datasets, use the Feature engineering option to complete any data preparation before running the model. You can schedule non-model tasks to prepare data before running a model.

Any code you need to run against the model must be present as a script in a Git repository defined for the project. The script needs to include a function such as run_task.
