Data Scientists and AI Engineers can use the Feature engineering option to run and schedule data preparation tasks with Python scripts before runnin a model.

Any code you need to run against the model must be present as a script in a Git repository defined for the project, or you can upload the script. The script needs to include a function such as run_task.

**Note:** Git files for Feature engineering are not currently supported in VantageCloud Lake.
