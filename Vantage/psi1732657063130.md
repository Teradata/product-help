After creating a project with models, dataset templates and datasets, you can trigger the feature engineering tasks against your data to ensure the data is preprocessed and transformed in the most efficient way possible. Use the Feature Engineering module if your data or model requires some kind of Extract Transform Load (ETL) process.

From the environment, select **AI workbench** > **ModelOps** > **Projects** > the project > **Feature Engineering** in the Navigation bar.
