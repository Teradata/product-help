The share defines what datasets are shared and which users subscribe to the share.

Share providers and admins can create shares. When you create a share, you become the owner of that share.

Share names are case-sensitive.

**In-place share** means that the shared data resides in a single VantageCloud Lake environment.

**Note:** You cannot change the name or type of share once it is created. Use the **Settings** tab to update the description.

Once you create a share, you can add [datasets](rfg1681040443995.md) and [subscribers](vph1681040670091.md).
