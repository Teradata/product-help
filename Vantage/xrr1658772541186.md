An organization admin (or other users with the necessary permissions) can create compute groups.

The compute group type determines the maximum number of parallel queries that can run on the compute group. With fewer queries, more memory and CPU are available. A compute group can have multiple [compute profiles](dvl1640281718303.md) and users can belong to more than one compute group.

**Note:** The APPLY table operator always runs on the **Analytic** compute group type. Teradata recommends using an analytic compute group when running an external UDF.
