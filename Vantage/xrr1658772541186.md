Query strategy determines the maximum number of parallel queries that can run on the compute group. The default is STANDARD (20).

Analytic compute clusters are designed for running analytic workloads.

On an analytic compute cluster, a maximum of 10 queries can run concurrently on the nodes (half as many as on a standard compute cluster). With fewer concurrent queries, more memory and CPU are available for running the analytic workloads, reducing resource contention with other workloads.

To create an analytic compute group, specify ANALYTIC (10). The APPLY table operator always runs on an analytic compute group. Teradata recommends using an analytic compute group when running an external UDF.
