If you have been granted access to any [compute groups](mqu1640280532737.md), you can select the one on which to run your query. If you don't select a compute group, your query runs on the [primary cluster](nmr1658424425362.md).

To run a query:

1.  Select a database in the **Objects** browser.


1.  Add a new script tab.


1.  Type or paste the SQL statement or script. You can open and use an existing script.

    **Note:** You can drag any table name over from the **Objects** browser.


1.  **Run** the script.


You can sort and filter the results. You can download them in JSON or CSV format, or copy them to the clipboard.

**Note:** Scripts are stored in your browser history. Unless you add them, your scripts do not appear if you use another browser or if you clear your browser history.
