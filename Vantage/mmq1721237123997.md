Database administrators (DBAs) keep the database at peak performance, and ensure that the data is secure and protected. DBAs are database users who perform a variety of administrative tasks.

As an organization admin, you can create the first (primary) DBA for environments from an environmentâ€™s dashboard. The primary DBA user can then create any subsequent DBAs and users for the environment.

**Note:** Some options may be pre-selected or unavailable in a VantageCloud Lake trial environment.
