Database administrators (DBAs) are responsible for keeping the database at peak performance, and for ensuring that the data is secure and protected. DBAs are database users who perform a variety of administrative tasks.

As an organization admin, you can create the first DBA for environments by selecting Create database administrator from an environmentâ€™s dashboard. Once the primary DBA is created, the DBA user can create any subsequent DBAs and users for the environment.

**Note:** Some options may be pre-selected or unavailable in a VantageCloud Lake trial environment.

    The root password belongs to the username DBC and was established when you created the environment. If you have forgotten your password, call your Teradata support representative.

1.  Select **Create**.

    You can optionally select **Show SQL** to view the assigned privileges before creating the database admin user. This is a view-only screen. If an error occurs, try again or call contact your support administrator.
