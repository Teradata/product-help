ModelOps admin users who create projects can also add a *service dataset connection* for use with deployments. See [Dataset Connections](wkm1725389190945.md).

**Note:** When selecting a project that does not have a personal dataset connection associated with it, you will be prompted to add or **Skip** selecting the default personal dataset connection.
