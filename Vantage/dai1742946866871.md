The data source selection depends on the type of **Content-based** data you defined in the definition step.

-   **Prepared data**

    -   Use the database menu to select a supported table for your vector store data. Prepared data refers to text segments, chunks, or documents which need to be converted into vectors. Select a table that contains pre-chunked text stored in a CHAR or VARCHAR column.


    -   Only single column from a single table selection is currently supported.


    -   You can add more columns with the same name from a different tables later.


-   **Raw data**


-   Select **Browse** or drag and drop PDF content from your local hard drive to convert into vectors. Raw data refers to files which need to be processed and converted into text segments, then the segments are converted into vectors.


-   Only PDF files are supported.


-   Files are not processed until the vector store process has been initiated.


-   Source files are not kept on the system, only the vectorized data.
