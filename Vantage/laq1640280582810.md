**Internet** is the default connection type. This is a public connection. If you select it, configure your network to allow connections to port `1025` on <public-ip>.

To use the **Private link** connection type for a secure connection, submit a change request to have it enabled. Once it is enabled, apply it to an environment:

1.  In the environment, select **Settings**.

1.  From the **Connection type** menu, select **Private link**.

1.  Enter the AWS **AllowListed Accounts** addresses in a comma-separated list, then select **Save**.
