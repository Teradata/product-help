# Network


Use Internet or Private link to connect to the POG router across accounts. Internet is the default connection type. If you use Internet, configure your network to allow connections to port `1025` on `<public-ip>`.

To create a private and secure connection to the POG router across accounts, select **Enable Private link**. You can disable Private Link at any time.

## Enable Private Link


Select a database account, then select **Network**>**Enable Private link**.

Enter one or more allowlisted AWS accounts separated by commas, then select **Enable**. You will see a status of **Pending** until Private Link is fully enabled. This may take several minutes, depending on the number of accounts specified.

**Tip:** After Private Link is fully enabled, select **+** to add additional allowlisted AWS accounts.
