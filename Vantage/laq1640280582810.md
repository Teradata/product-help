Once your environment is deployed, you can configure how users connect to it.

In the environment, select **Settings**.

**Internet** is a public connection. If you select it, configure your network to allow connections to port `1025` on `public-ip`.

**Private link** is a secure connection type. If connecting through Azure, copy the endpoint address that appears after provisioning to create a private endpoint in the Azure portal.
