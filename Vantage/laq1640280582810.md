Once your environment is deployed, you can configure how users connect to it and view the settings that were applied.

In the environment, select **Settings**.

## Instance size


The instance size displayed is determined during the creation of the environment.

## Storage encryption


The type of encryption for your data storage determined during the creation of the environment.

During the [environment creation](qiv1640281527006.md), you had the option to have data storage managed by Teradata or by your organization.When **Customer managed** is selected when creating the environment, an AWS encryption key ID must be entered. The encryption key can be manually rotated here.

Teradata recommends rotating the encryption key a minimum of every 6 months and aligned with system upgrade to limit any downtime. The last good key rotation date is displayed for your convenience. Selecting **Rotate Key** opens a window for you to enter the new key.

If the key rotation fails, then the environment keeps the last known good state until the correct key is provided.

If the default storage was selected (not customer managed), then data is protected with the platform-managed encryption keys by Teradata and updated during system upgrades.

## Network


**Internet connection** is a public connection. If you select it, configure your network to allow connections to port `1025` on `public-ip`.

**Private link** is a secure connection type.

If you are using Private Link with Azure, copy the **Endpoint address** that appears after Private Link provisioning is complete. Use it in the Azure Portal to create a private endpoint.
