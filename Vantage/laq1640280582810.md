Once your environment is deployed, you can configure how users connect to it.

In the environment, select **Settings**.

## Instance size


The instance size displayed is determined during the creation of the environment.

## Storage encryption


If your organization opted to control the encryption keys for all their data, then the message `All customer data stored is encrypted automatically` is displayed.

During the [environment creation](qiv1640281527006.md), you have the option to have data storage managed by Teradata or your organization.When **Customer managed** is selected, the encryption key ID is entered. You can manually rotate the encryption key here if it hasn't been set to auto rotate.

## Network


**Internet connection** is a public connection. If you select it, configure your network to allow connections to port `1025` on `public-ip`.

**Private link** is a secure connection type.

If you are using Private Link with Azure, copy the **Endpoint address** that appears after Private Link provisioning is complete. Use it in the Azure Portal to create a private endpoint.
