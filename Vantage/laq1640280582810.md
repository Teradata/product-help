Once your environment is deployed, you can configure how users connect to it.

In the environment, select **Settings**.

**Internet connection** is a public connection. If you select it, configure your network to allow connections to port `1025` on `public-ip`.

**Private link** is a secure connection type.

If you are using Private Link with Azure, copy the **Endpoint address** that appears after Private Link provisioning is complete. Use it in the Azure Portal to create a private endpoint.
