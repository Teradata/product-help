You can analyze, build, and run queries using the preloaded in-database functions in Editor. This alleviates the need to run SQL or Python manually. You can access the function explorer by selecting the ![""](Images/iug1692136295838.svg) icon in Editor.

You can search for a function to narrow down the options. After selecting a function, do one of the following:

-   Select **Build query** to build the query using the prompts instead of manually coding.


-   Select ![""](Images/voj1588803808402.svg) to view and copy the SQL syntax and continue building your query.
