After you are [connected to an environment](iql1691540875799.md) in Editor, use the in-database analytics functions explorer (![""](Images/iug1692136295838.svg)) to learn about preloaded functions and build queries with them. No coding is required.

Search for a function to narrow down your options. Or explore functions by category and read about what they do.

Select **Build query**, add values, then **View Query**. Run the query in Editor, and save the results in a permanent or temporary table or view.

Or select ![""](Images/voj1588803808402.svg) to view, and then copy, a function's SQL template if you'd like to write a SQL query yourself in Editor.
