You can analyze, build, and run queries without using SQL or Python script with the in-database functions in Editor. You can access the function explorer by selecting the Sigma sign in Editor.

-   Copy the SQL syntax and continue building your query.

-   Use the Build Query feature to help you build the query without any coding.
