Use the in-database analytics functions explorer (![""](Images/iug1692136295838.svg)) to easily analyze and build queries using the preloaded functions in Editor without the need to code. You can save the results in a permanent or temporary table or view by enabling **Create table or view with the full result**.

You can search for a function to narrow down the options. After selecting a function, do one of the following:

-   Select **Build query** to build the query using the prompts instead of manually coding.

    After entering the values for your query, select **View Query** to have it automatically build. Once in Editor, you can select **Run**.


-   Select ![""](Images/voj1588803808402.svg) to view and copy the SQL syntax and continue building your query.
