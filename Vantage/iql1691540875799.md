Use the in-database analytics functions explorer (![""](Images/iug1692136295838.svg)), in Editor, to learn about preloaded functions and build queries with them. No coding is required.

Search for a function to narrow down your options. Or explore functions by category and read about what they do.

Select **Build query**, add values, then **View Query**.

Run the query, and save the results in a permanent or temporary table or view.

Or if you'd like to write a query yourself, select ![""](Images/voj1588803808402.svg) to copy the SQL.
