You connect to an environment as a database user.

From the **Objects** pane or any script, connect one of the following ways:

-   Add a connection by entering your account credentials.


-   Select a recently used connection, if available.


Once you are connected, all the databases you have permission to use appear. You can make one your default.

To end the connection and remove it from the drop-down list, select **Remove**.
