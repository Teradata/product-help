You connect to an environment as a database user.

From the **Objects** browser or any script, connect one of the following ways:

-   Add a connection by entering your database user account credentials. You can choose to make this your default connection.


-   Select a recently used connection, if available.


Once you are connected, all the databases you have permission to use appear in the **Objects** browser. You can browse them or search for databases, users, tables, and views.

You can end a connection, which removes it from the drop-down list.
