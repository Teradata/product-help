The **Jobs** tab is not displayed if the **Enable scheduling** option was cleared when you deployed the model.

The jobs for batch prediction or scoring are displayed, along with the next execution date and time for the job that was set while deploying the model. You can trigger a job manually at any time by selecting **Run Now** even when it has a schedule.

Use the following properties to run a scoring job manually:

-   Docker image


-   Notes


-   Advanced options

    -   Resource template


    -   Build properties
