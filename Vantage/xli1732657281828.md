During each step of the feature engineering task lifecycleâ€”from import to deploymentâ€”ModelOps runs a job to perform the required processing. The following types of jobs are run to complete each step of the feature engineering task lifecycle:

-   **Import**

    Loads the feature engineering script into the system.


-   **Run**

    Runs the script to perform the intended task.


-   **Approve**

    Approve the feature engineering task to move forward with deploying the task.


-   **Deploy**

    Deploys a feature engineering task in production.


-   **Retire**

    Retires the feature engineering task from production.


You can view logs of a job to track the job and diagnose errors and warnings that occurred during the processing of the job. Each job also has a lifecycle that includes events from creation to completion.
