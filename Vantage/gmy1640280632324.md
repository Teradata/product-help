# QueryGrid


[testing] There are issues with the output when it comes to internal xrefs. Also, the bullets are not appearing in the output. This was noticed in the 6.3 update last summer in regular dita projects.

The following is a <ul> list with styles set to Pure:

-   This is text: text

-   This is a new bullet with text: text

-   This is a bullet with an xref to deployment: [Deployment](wrw1640282047881.md)

-   This next bullet is an xref to management:

-   [Management](lzm1640282103875.md)


This is a new paragraph. See Management topic for Basic style settings.
