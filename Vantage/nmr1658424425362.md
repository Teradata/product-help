An environment has the following components:

-   **Primary cluster**

    Each environment has one primary cluster, which is a set of connected nodes plus permanent block storage. The primary cluster manages query planning and the distribution of work across the environment.


-   **Compute groups**

    Compute groups are optional. They contain compute clusters that are separate from the primary cluster. Use profiles to manage the compute clusters in a compute group.


-   **Compute clusters**

    Compute clusters are optional sets of connected nodes for compute-intensive query steps. They free the primary cluster to perform session management, parsing engine functions, and tactical or other short-term functions.
