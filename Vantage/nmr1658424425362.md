An account enables you to run queries, view current and historical query data, manage user access, and create and manage Compute Groups in VantageCloud Lake. An account consists of the following components:

-   **Primary Cluster**: An account has one Primary Cluster per account. The Primary Cluster is the hub of an account. It includes databases consisting of BYNET-connected nodes, and optionally Compute Clusters and Compute Workers. Access Module Processors in the nodes process data from parsing engines and move and manage data from disk drives. Each processor owns its assigned data and has its own instance of the Teradata file system.

-   **Compute Clusters**: Compute Clusters are optional, independent, scalable clusters used to offload compute-intensive query steps from the Primary Cluster. They are connected to the Primary Cluster by Vantage Query Fabric, which provides parallel and scalable connectivity between the Primary Cluster and multiple Compute Clusters and load balancing between multiple Compute Clusters and transfers finalized query steps for execution. You can have multiple Compute Clusters and assign them to Compute Groups.

-   **Compute Workers**: Computer Workers are optional, compute-only components like standard Advanced SQL Engine nodes, but without permanent storage or parsing engines. They are optimal for heavy-processing work, so using them for that work frees up standard nodes on the Primary Cluster.
