An environment can have two types of compute resources:

-   **Primary cluster**

    Each environment has one primary cluster, which manages query planning and the distribution of work across the environment. The primary cluster is a group of connected nodes plus block storage.


-   **Compute groups**

    Optionally, you can create scalable [compute groups](mqu1640280532737.md)for an environment.
