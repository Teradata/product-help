An environment can have two types of compute resources:

-   **Primary cluster**

    Each environment has one.


-   **Compute workers**

    Optionally, for the management of heavy workloads, you can add [compute workers](lyi1662583368110.md) to the primary cluster.


-   **Compute groups**

    Optionally, you can create scalable compute groups for an environment.
