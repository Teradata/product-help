**Important!** Data copy requires **QueryGrid** to be provisioned and configured to connect to external Vantage systems.

Use **Data copy** to copy data between two VantageCloud Lake environments or from an external Vantage system to VantageCloud Lake. Data copy uses **QueryGrid** as the copy method to perform full or partial table copies.

Data copy supports the following bidirectional source and target database connections:

|Source|Target|
|-------|-------|
|VantageCloud Lake on AWS|VantageCloud Lake on AWS|
|VantageCloud Enterprise on AWS|VantageCloud Lake on AWS|
|VantageCore (on-premises)|VantageCloud Lake on AWS|
|VantageCloud Lake on Azure|VantageCloud Lake on Azure|
|VantageCloud Enterprise on Azure|VantageCloud Lake on Azure|
|VantageCore (on-premises)|VantageCloud Lake on Azure|
