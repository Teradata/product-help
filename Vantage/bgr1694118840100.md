Use **Data copy** to copy data between two VantageCloud Lake environments or between VantageCloud Lake and a VantageCloud Enterprise or VantageCore environment. Data copy uses **QueryGrid** as the copy method to perform full or partial table copies.

Data copy supports the following *bidirectional* source and target database connections:

|Source (local)|Target (external)|
|---------------|------------------|
|VantageCloud Lake on AWS|VantageCloud Lake on AWS|
|VantageCloud Enterprise on AWS|VantageCloud Lake on AWS|
|VantageCore (on-premises)|VantageCloud Lake on AWS|
|VantageCloud Lake on Azure|VantageCloud Lake on Azure|
|VantageCloud Enterprise on Azure|VantageCloud Lake on Azure|
|VantageCore (on-premises)|VantageCloud Lake on Azure|

**Important!** Data copy requires **QueryGrid** to be provisioned and configured to connect to the target Vantage systems VantageCloud Lake, VantageCloud Enterprise, or VantageCore.
