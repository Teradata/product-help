Use the Deployments option to view and monitor all model versions of a project that are deployed to production (*active* deployments), and take an action based on the model's performance. Model deployment integrates a model into an existing production environment to make practical business decisions based on data.

A model deployment status can be active or retired (no longer running in production).

**Types of Deployments**

ModelOps supports the following deployment types:

-   **In-Vantage**

    Use Vantage to perform the model deployment.


-   **Docker Batch**

    Start a batch deployment of your model by processing input data from a dataset template and data connection and storing the output to a table. Batch deployments can be run on demand or based on a schedule.


-   **Docker RESTful**

    **Note:** RESTful deployments are not supported in VantageCloud Lake.

    Deploy your model as a REST API service.


From the ModelOps dashboard, select **Deployments** > a deployment.
