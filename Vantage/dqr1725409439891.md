Model deployment integrates a model into an existing production environment to make practical business decisions based on data. Use the Deployments module to view and monitor all model versions of a project that are deployed to production, and take an action based on the models' performance.

A model deployment status can be active or retired. The Deployments list shows both types of deployments.

**Types of Deployments**

ModelOps supports the following deployment types:

-   In-Vantage: Use Advanced SQL Engine to perform the model deployment.


-   Docker Batch: Execute batch deployment of your model by processing input data from a dataset template and data connection and storing the output to a table. Batch deployments can be run on demand or based on a schedule.


-   Docker RESTful: Deploy your model as a REST API service.


From the environment, select **AI workbench** > **ModelOps** > **Projects** > **Deployments** > a deployment.
