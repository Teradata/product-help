## How do I enable vector store?


An organization admin must first enable the feature in your environment. From the home page, select an environment > **Settings > Vector store > Enable**.

**Note:** Semantic search using vector store is only available using notebooks.

## What platforms support vector store?


Vector store for the VantageCloud Lake console is supported by AWS.

## What types of data can be stored in the vector store?


You can store text-based vector embeddings generated from PDFS or structured data. Images or multimodal vectors are not supported.

## How is data secured in vector store?


Vector store inherits your environment's role-based access. Once content is embedded, its semantic meaning could be accessible trough similarity - even if the original data was restricted. It is important to not embed sensitive or proprietary data without proper scoping.

## What happens if I delete source content?


Deleting a document from its original source does not remove the embedded version in the vector store. The vector store must be manually cleaned up. See [Manage vector store](xpf1742341027956.md).

## Are vector queries always accurate?


No. The vector store uses pre-configured embedding models optimized for general purpose semantic tasks. Custom embeddings are not supported.

## How large can a vector collection be?


A vector store can scale millions of vectors, but performance my vary depending on the embedding dimensions, indexing strategy, and query frequency.

## What if my vector store data is stale?


Source content does not automatically update. To maintain accuracy, you need to manually add the updated content. See [Edit vector store](dpw1742341058646.md).
