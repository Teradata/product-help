## How recent is the data?

## How do I know if my company is paying for storage on an on-demand basis?


For block storage, if the total provisioned on all your environments exceeds your committed amount, your company pays for any additional provisioned amount each month. For object storage, if the total consumed by all your environments exceeds your committed amount, your company pays for any additional amount consumed each month. Each monthly amount is the average for that month.
