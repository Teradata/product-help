## Edit a copy plan


As a db_user, you can edit any copy plan. You can go back to sql editor to make sure that the tables were created. You can check before running or creating the plan that the table doesn't already exist in the database by using sql editor. If you cancel the edit without saving, all changes are deleted.

The cleanup default is 60 days when data is above 50% capacity.

## Start, Cancel, Pause, and Restart a copy plan


You can cancel a running plan. When you cancel a plan, only the tables that have not yet copied from the source to target database are stopped. The tables that have been copied over successfully are not deleted and any tables in the process of copying will be completed.
