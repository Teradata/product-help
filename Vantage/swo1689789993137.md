An identity provider stores, secures, and authenticates the digital identities of users. Examples of identity providers include Azure Active Directory, Okta, and Ping.

From the navigation panel, select **Organization** > **Access Management** > **Identity providers**.

## Identity provider types


VantageCloud Lake supports the OpenID Connect and SAML 2.0 authentication protocols. The information you need from your identity provider portal depends on the authentication protocol you use:

-   [What you need for OpenID Connect](dbu1689789992954.md)

-   [What you need for SAML 2.0](tzl1689789991630.md)


## What's next?


After you add the identity provider, [set up the realm](akz1689789991814.md).

**Important!** VantageCloud Lake single sign-on does not currently support just-in-time database user provisioning. You must [create database users](bzs1689789992898.md) separately, using the same username used by the identity provider for valid authentication and authorization.
