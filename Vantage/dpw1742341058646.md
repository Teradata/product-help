You can update a vector store with new parameters and data as needed. From the vector store main page, use the menu to select **Edit**. From the [Definition](nly1742946843656.md), [Data sources](dai1742946866871.md), and [Settings](smv1742946887645.md) tabs to make changes.

Usage notes:

-   The name, location, and type of the vector store cannot be changed after creation.


-   You cannot add or remove embedded columns.


-   It is not recommended you change indexing parameters, the system will re-index all existing data embedded in the vector store. This could impact system performance or availability.


-   For additional details, see [Create vector store: Settings](smv1742946887645.md).
