**Note:** Git models are not currently supported in VantageCloud Lake.

Use the **Model versions** page to train a Git model, generate a new model version, or import a BYOM that has been externally trained to become a new model version. You can also initiate the model version lifecycle, compare models, view and download artifacts, and manage partitioned models within this workspace. From here, you can also compute the dataset statistics (only for BYOM models). See [Compute statistics](fby1743624401813.md).
