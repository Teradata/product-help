**Note:** If you use an Internet connection, you must configure your network to allow connections to port 1025 on**public-ip**. Check with your system administrator for details.

1.  From the **Home** page, select an environment.


1.  Select **Settings** ![Settings icon](Images/gkz1722447366517.svg) from menu and enable the **Internet connection** option.


1.  Add each IP address allowed to connect to the environment.

    Separate each IP address by a comma ( , ) or put each address on a new line.

    **Tip:** To add a range of IP addresses, use the CIDR (Classless Inter-Domain Routing format). For example, use 192.168.2.0/24 to specify all IP addresses from 192.168.2.0 to 192.168.2.255.
