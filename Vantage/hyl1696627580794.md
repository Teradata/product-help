After Private Link provisioning for the environment is complete, copy the **Endpoint address** that is generated to use in the Azure Portal to create a private endpoint.

For general steps, see [Quickstart: Create a private endpoint by using the Azure portal](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/private-link/create-private-endpoint-portal?tabs=dynamic-ip).

1.  From the **Home** page, select an environment.


1.  Select **Settings** ![Settings icon](Images/gkz1722447366517.svg) from the menu and enable the **Private link** option.


1.  In the **Allowlisted accounts**, enter the Azure subscription IDs to be allowed to connect to the environment. Separate each account with a comma.

    Select the resource ID connection method, and paste the copied endpoint address as the resource ID.


1.  Once added as a trusted account in the VantageCloud Lake console, select the resource group in the Azure Portal to host the endpoint. Use this to connect to an Azure resource by **Resource ID** or **Alias**. This is where you paste the service name from the VantageCloud Lake console.


1.  For networking, choose a virtual network or subnet in the same region as where the VantageCloud Lake environment is deployed.

    The region can be found in the environment's **Overview** tab in VantageCloud Lake.


1.  Once created, copy the private ID for the endpoint as the **DNS name** in the VantageCloud Lake console.


1.  Select **Save**.
