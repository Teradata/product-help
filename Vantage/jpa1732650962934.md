Model artifacts are the output created by the training or evaluation processes. The output can be a fully trained model, a model checkpoint (for resuming training later), or simply a file created during the training process such as an image generated while training a model. You can view and download training, evaluation, scoring, and compute statistics artifacts of a model version by selecting the **Artifacts** tab.
