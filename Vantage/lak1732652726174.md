To compute feature metadata, VantageCloud Lake runs a job to perform the generation or regeneration of feature metadata. Feature metadata information is required when computing statistics during training, scoring, and so on. This metadata depends on the feature type (categorical or continuous). You can view logs of a job to track the job and diagnose errors and warnings that occurred during the processing of the job. Each job also has a lifecycle that includes events from creation to completion.

From the ModelOps dashboard, select the project > **Jobs** > the compute feature metadata job > ![kebab menu](Images/zsz1597101912145.svg) > **View details**.
