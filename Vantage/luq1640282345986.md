CCP or **tcstreamjob** is used to create a stream.

-   Use **tcstreamjob** from the account to create a stream.

-   Use **tcstreamjob** to compose a JSON disposition document.

-   Use **tcstreamsec** to configure security on assets. Compose disposition documents manually, if needed, and supply them to **tcstreamsec**.


**Note:** If composing a stream from the account, properly secure assets prior to composing the stream. **tcstreamsec** supports configuring security prior to composing the stream for this purpose. Alternately, you may choose to manually apply security.
