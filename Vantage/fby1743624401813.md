You can compute statistics for your features and targets when you create or edit a dataset template. Storing the feature statistics information is required to have data drift monitoring.

1.  See [Create dataset template](frd1725409311264.md) for steps to access the **Features** tab.


1.  Under the **Features** tab, after running the SQL query to retrieve the features, the feature table displays all the available features. Select **Validate metadata**.

    ModelOps displays a warning for targets missing statistics and the option to generate or re-generate statistics for the selected target.


1.  To generate metadata, select the feature type for each feature you want to include by checking the box next to each one in the table.


1.  Select **Generate metadata** to generate metadata for features missing it.

    Select **Regenerate metadata** to update existing metadata.


1.  Verify the feature names in the dialog, then select **Generate metadata** or **Regenerate metadata**.

    The compute statistics job is started.


1.  Select ![Close icon](Images/teg1680569591203.svg) when the compute statistics progress completes.


1.  Once valid metadata is available, select **View details** to view the statistics computed.

    The same process can be applied to the target as well.


For BYOM, a compute statistics job runs after importing the model. To manually run it for a BYOM model, right click on a model version > **Compute statistics**.
