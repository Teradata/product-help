Use compute groups to provide compute resources to specific departments, applications, or projects for separate processing, monitoring, and billing. They are ideal for periodic, special-purpose tasks such as month-end processing, exploration, and projects.

From the navigation panel, select **Environments** > the environment > **Compute groups**.
