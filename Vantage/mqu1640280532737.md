Use compute groups to provide compute resources to specific departments, applications, or projects for separate processing, monitoring, and billing.

They are ideal for periodic, special-purpose tasks such as month-end processing, exploration, and projects.

Compute groups contain compute clusters, sets of connected nodes independent of the primary cluster. Compute clusters perform compute-intensive query steps to free the primary cluster for session management, parsing engine functions, and tactical or other short-term functions.

Use compute profiles to [manage a compute group's capacity](dvl1640281718303.md).

Compute groups have these characteristics:

-   With no service interruption, they can be started to accommodate bigger workloads and stopped when no longer needed (to lower costs).


-   They can directly access large tables in the Object File System.


-   They hold intermediate data in memory or in internal drives.


-   They store no permanent data.


-   They are 100% fault-isolated from system-wide failures.


-   They are independently upgradeable to newer versions of software without disrupting the rest of the system.
