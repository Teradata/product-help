You can choose to collect one or both types of error logs to help Teradata Support resolve issues the flow may encounter:

-   **Debug** provides detailed error logging.


-   **Timed** records the time it takes to complete certain processes, including:

    -   Compose a manifest file


    -   Execute each load query


    -   Commit the load


    -   Clean up manifests


Set the maximum number of errors to detect in the source data, per streamed microbatch, before stopping the flow.
