The root (DBC) user owns all the space in the environment. As you create new databases and users, any permanent space you grant them is subtracted from the root userâ€™s available permanent space.

**Important!** Avoid working as the root user unless necessary. Create database administrators (DBAs) to manage users and most database tasks.
