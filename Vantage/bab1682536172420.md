## Flow service (AWS)


Flow provides simple, self-service data loading into VantageCloud Lake through VantageCloud Lake Console.

You can use Flow for initial bulk loads, scheduled loads, and continuous loads that recur at the frequency you specify. You can quickly load your data and start analyzing it, and set up continuous load jobs that keep your data and analytics fresh.

**Note:** To use Flow, create a new environment. Flow is not available to environments created before this release.

## VantageCloud Lake Supported AWS regions


VantageCloud Lake on AWS is now available in the AWS Tokyo region:

-   Region name: Asia Pacific (Tokyo)

-   Region: ap-northeast-1


## Consumption usage available for Compute Groups


You can view consumption usage by compute groups. Drill down on an environment on the Consumption page to view the environmentâ€™s compute groups. This helps you assess overall usage, and manage costs based on usage.

## Restoring data to the same site


You can restore data from a backup plan to the same site.

## External routine installation tool updates


The External Routine Installation Tool (tdextroutine) was updated in this release. To use this tool to create and manage your UDFs, do the following:

1.  Download the updated tdextroutine tool from the Teradata Software Download portal.

1.  Submit a Change Request (CR) to Teradata Support or ask your account team to do the following:

    1.  Go to [https://support.teradata.com](https://support.teradata.com).com and select **Request a Change**.

    1.  Fill out the form, and ask Teradata Support to `enable your UDF client` and to direct this request to `Cloud Ops`.

    1.  In your CR, include the value *org_key-udf-device*, where *org_key* is your organization name.

        You can get your organization name from the URL you use to access the VantageCloud Lake Console. For example,*organization_name.innovationlabs.teradata.com*.

1.  After the UDF Client is enabled, you can use tdextroutine.

    The Username (-u, --username) is mandatory, but a password (-p, --password) is no longer required.

1.  The first time you run a tdextroutine command, the tool opens a default browser in Windows or Mac and prompts you to authenticate. Follow the prompts in the browser and enter this information:

    1.  On the first screen, enter `TD2 Creds/SSO`.

    1.  On the second screen, confirm the code displayed in the UI if it matches the code at the end of the URL printed in the command line.

    1.  For headless systems, copy the URL displayed in the command line and authenticate the device by opening it in a browser on another machine.

1.  Caching the JWT token:

    -   If using the --cache_auth option (this is the default), the JWT token is cached and stored securely, and you will not have to authenticate when issuing subsequent commands within the next 2 hours.

    -   If using the --no_cache_auth option, all commands require confirmation as described in step 4. However, only the code needs to be confirmed. Login is not required if using the same browser until the browser session expires.

1.  When the 2 hour period ends, you will have to authenticate again to use tdextroutine. See step 4.
