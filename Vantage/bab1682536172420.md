## VantageCloud Lake on Azure


Microsoft Azure is now supported as a Cloud Service Provider on VantageCloud Lake. This expands VantageCloud Lake cloud service provider compatibility and enables direct integration with Microsoft native services like the Azure Data Factory and access to data in the Azure Marketplace.

## QueryGrid (Azure)


QueryGrid 3.02 supports VantageCloud Lake on Azure with the following connectivity options:

-   VantageCloud Enterprise on Azure

-   VantageCore (on-premises)


## Updated consumption units


The consumption units for the primary cluster have been updated. In addition, units for Azure were included.

## In-place data sharing (AWS)


You can now share datasets "in place" (no data movement or duplication required) between users of the same environment through the VantageCloud Lake Console to foster collaboration.

**Note:** This capability is in Limited Availability (Preview) and only available to selected customers. Contact your sales representative if you are interested in having early access to it.

## Workload Management Default Workloads


With the new VantageCloud Lake default workloads introduced in this release, all active queries that are not otherwise assigned a priority will automatically be given a priority based on their query characteristics. If you want to override this behavior, you can use account strings for workload classification to a single priority.

## Active Query Monitoring and Management


You can inspect an environment's queries to understand their efficiency. View query metrics from the VantageCloud Lake Console.

## Query Log Data Querying Optimizations

## Bring Your Own Viewpoint (BYOVP)

## Autoscaling Enhancements for Compute Clusters


Compute clusters now support 60 concurrent queries instead of 15, which improves the performance of running queries.

## APPLY Table Operator


The APPLY table operator now supports the following data types:

-   TIME with format HH:MM:SS.S(F)

-   TIMESTAMP with format YYYY-MM-DD HH:MM:SS.S(F)Z

-   TIME WITH TIME ZONE with format HH:MM:SS.S(F)Z
