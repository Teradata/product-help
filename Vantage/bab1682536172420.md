## ALTER TABLE Can Convert Empty Block File System Table to Object File System Table


The ALTER TABLE statement can convert an empty Block File System table to an Object File System table.

## Sort Operations Pass Results Directly to Consumers


Sort operations pass their results directly to consumer operations, without temporarily storing them on spools. This approach, called pipelining, reduces spool usage, which improves query and system performance and may also reduce storage cost.

The EXPLAIN output shows when VantageCloud Lake uses pipelining.

## Open Analytics Framework Supported on VantageCloud Lake on Azure


Building scalable Python and R analytics with Open Analytics Framework is now supported on VantageCloud Lake on Azure.

## Open Analytics Framework and teradataml Enables R Language Analytics


You can create customized R environments based on R language versions 4.0.x or 4.1.x, and download and install R libraries from CRAN. You can then run R scripts using APPLY table operator query.

## Active Query Monitoring and Management Update (AWS)


Active query monitoring is enhanced so that when you click on the parent query from the Summary view, a detail view loads with child queries (if any) and their associated metrics in the new Query Band and Skew tabs.

## New Analytic Function


The following analytic function is new to this release:

-   TD_DWT performs discrete wavelet transform (DWT) for digital signal processing.


-   TD_DWT2D performs DWT for two-dimensional data, such as an image.


-   TD_IDWT performs inverse discrete wavelet transform (IDWT) for digital signal processing.


-   TD_IDW2D performs IDWT for two-dimensional data, such as an image.


-   TD_IQR uses interquartile range to identify data points, events and observations that deviate from the normal behavior of the data set.


-   TD_Unpivoting


-   Unpivots the data, that is, changes the data from dense format to sparse format.


## Updated Analytic Functions


The following analytic functions are updated in this release:

-   TD_GLM

    TD_GLM has been combined with TD_GLMPerSegment. You can now use Partition By Any and Partition By partition_column with TD_GLMPredict. TD_GLMPredictPerSegment should not be used.


-   TD_GLMPredict

    TD_GLMPredict has been combined with TD_GLMPredictPerSegment. You can now use Partition By Any and Partition By Key with TD_GLM. TD_GLMPerSegment should not be used.


-   TD_Scalefit

    Added Partition By support so different partitions in a dataset can be scaled independently of each other.


-   Added ParameterTable and Attribute table support to enable you to apply different parameters and attributes for different partitions.


-   Added optional argument IgnoreInvalidLocationScale.


-   TD_ScaleTransform

    Added Partition By support so different partitions in a dataset can be scaled independently of each other.


## C/C++ UDF Support in Azure


C/C++ UDFs can run on both the primary cluster and compute cluster for Azure.
