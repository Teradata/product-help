For complete information on the **May 2023** update and all prior releases, see [What's new](https://docs.teradata.com/r/Teradata-VantageCloud-Lake/What-s-New).

## Create, Use, and Migrate User-defined Functions to VantageCloud Lake


You can create and manage SQL and C or C++ user-defined functions (UDFs) in VantageCloud Lake. Scalar UDFs, aggregate UDFs, and table operators can run on the primary cluster or on compute clusters. Table functions currently run only on the primary cluster.

You can also migrate SQL scripts (BTEQ files) that create C or C++ UDFs in VantageCloud Enterprise or VantageCore to VantageCloud Lake.

## Bring Your Own Model


Data Scientists and Data Analysts can now insert existing predictive Dataiku models to a Vantage model table and score data in Vantage.

## QueryGrid


QueryGrid 3.0 now supports query initiation from the following platforms:

-   VantageCloud Enterprise on AWS

-   VantageCore (on-premises)

-   VantageCloud Lake for Teradata-to-Teradata connectivity


## Consumption


The Consumption page provides visibility into an organization's compute and storage utilization. The page has the monthly consumption breakdown for the environment and organizations. You can refine the interval. For example, you can view hourly intervals to ensure that compute clusters are available during high-demand periods and inactive during low-demand periods. Weekly and monthly intervals help you assess overall usage and manage costs based on use.

## Bring Your Own Identity Provider


An identity provider stores, secures, and authenticates the digital identities of users. You can use your corporate identity provider (IDP) with VantageCloud Lake to authenticate users.

## New Analytic Functions


The following analytic functions are available in VantageCloud Lake:

-   TD_GLMPerSegment: Trains a whole data set by partitioning, and creates a single model for each partition.

-   TD_GLMPredictPerSegment: Predicts target value (regression) and class label (classification) for test data using a corresponding GLM model trained using TD_GLMPerSegment.

-   TD_TargetEncodingFit: Generates hyperparameters for use by TD_TargetEncodingTransform.

-   TD_TargetEncodingTransform: Uses the hyperparameters generated by TD_TargetEncodingFit to encode categorical values.


## TD_GLMPredict Syntax Update


Information about syntax change for TD_GLMPredict is added. The `Model` alias is updated to `ModelTable` in the ON clause syntax for TD_GLMPredict.

## ALTER TABLE … SAVE | UNSAVE Update


The ALTER TABLE … SAVE | UNSAVE command now lets you save and unsave based on version number.

## SELECT ... AS OF version_number


You can now select data from a table based on version number.

## InDB Analytic Functions Explorer


The InDB Analytic Functions Explorer lets you discover, explore, and experiment with InDB analytic functions without writing code. You can access it from the Editor of the VantageCloud Lake Console. In this first version, it supports the SQLMR analytic functions.

## nPath Visualization


nPath Visualization helps you find hidden data patterns and analyze time series events data. nPath is especially useful when your goal is to identify the paths that lead to an outcome. For example, you can use nPath to analyze events including successful sales, fraudulent activities, and patient journeys.

## APPLY Table Operator


DATE with format YYYY-MM-DD is now a supported data type for the APPLY table operator.

## VantageCloud Lake on Azure


Microsoft Azure is now supported as a Cloud Service Provider on VantageCloud Lake. This expands VantageCloud Lake cloud service provider compatibility and enables direct integration with Microsoft native services like the Azure Data Factory and access to data in the Azure Marketplace.

## Workload Management Default Workloads


With the new VantageCloud Lake default workloads introduced in this release, all active queries that are not otherwise assigned a priority will automatically be given a priority based on their query characteristics. If you want to override this behavior, you can use account strings for workload classification to a single priority.
