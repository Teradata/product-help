## Third Party Applications (AWS)


Teradata now supports the integration of Third-Party Applications with VantageCloud Lake. These partner applications bring enhanced capabilities to the Teradata Analytics Database. This release supports the integration of Protegrity with VantageCloud Lake, offering a range of security compliance features such as custom-level tokenization, masking, and encryption. In this release, Protegrity is supported by AWS only.

**Note:** Partner certification of Third-Party Applications is required. At the time of publishing, the partner Protegrity has not yet completed the certification requirement and this status will be updated in the release notes when completed.

## Customer Managed Encryption Keys (AWS)


On AWS, Teradata now supports CMEK, including key rotation. You set up CMEK when creating the Environment.

## Personal Access Tokens


Personal Access Tokens can be used with Flow, user-defined functions, and the Open Analytics Frameworks. You can upload a public key or have Teradata generate a key pair. See [Manage access tokens](mwx1694115292045.md).

## Bring Your Own Model


BYOM 5.0 supports the DataRobotPredict function to perform scoring with DataRobot models.

The Dataiku runtime has been upgraded to 12.2.2.

## Escape Character (") in CSV Data is Stripped


If double quotes are used to enclose a field in a CSV file, a double quote character within a field must be escaped by another double quote. This release corrects a defect where the escape double quote character was included as part of the data being read from a CSV file. With this release, the escape double quote character will now be removed when reading the CSV file and will no longer be included as part of the field value.

## Document Set Evaluation


TD_TFIDF function is commonly used to determine how important a word is in relation to a document.

## Sparse Input Format Support


TD_ScaleFit and TD_ScaleTransform functions accept input data in sparse format, in addition to the already supported dense format. You can perform scaling on input dataset which is present in sparse format and perform scaling on greater number of attributes.

## Group-Value Input Format Support


TD_ANOVA, TD_FTest, and TD_ZTest functions support alternate input table format (group-value), in addition to the already supported column-wise format.

## TD_XGBoost Enhancements


Performance and usability enhancements like supporting alternate argument names for NumBoostedTrees, ShrinkageFactor, and IterNum (inline with open source libraries). Some additional changes like added BaseScore argument in the function syntax, default values for ShrinkageFactor changed to 0.5 and RegularizationLambada changed to 1, and so on.

## TD_XGBoostPredict Enhancements


Performance and usability enhancements like supporting alternate argument names for NumBoostRounds and IterNum (inline with open source libraries). Some additional changes like order by argument made optional, default values for IterNum increased from 3 to 10, and so on.

## Variable AMPs per Instance for Primary Cluster Temporarily Unavailable (AWS)


This feature, introduced for AWS and Azure in November 2023, is temporarily unavailable on AWS.
