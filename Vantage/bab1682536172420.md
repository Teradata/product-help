## Triggers Supported on Object File System Tables


VantageCloud Lake now supports triggers on tables in the Object File System.

## Scaling Primary Cluster Up and Down


When you initially provision an environment, you specify the instance size of the primary cluster.

After provisioning your environment, you can scale the original instance size up or down by up to two instance sizes.

Scale up for short-term increases in workload and data-intensive tasks to maintain optimal performance or speed up processing.

Scale down during periods of reduced demand to avoid paying for unused resources.

To scale your primary cluster up or down, you must submit a request.

## Block Storage Expansion for Primary Cluster


When you initially provision an environment, you specify the amount of block storage you want for the primary cluster.

After provisioning your environment, you can add block storage to the primary cluster in increments of 1 TB.

Block Storage expansion for the primary cluster cannot be reduced (rolled back) after being incremented.

To add block storage to the primary cluster, you must submit a request.

## Consumption Alert Email Notifications


Set alerts to notify you and others that consumption is approaching a threshold. More than one alert can be set for each organization.

## Single Table Join Indexes on Object File System Tables


Starting with this release, Single Table Join Indexes (STJIs) are supported on Object File System tables on the primary index.

## External Object Storage Platform Support


The following external object storage platforms are now supported:

-   Cloudera


-   Cloudian HyperStore


-   IBM Cloud Object Store (IBM COS)


-   RedHat Ceph

## Default DBQL Logging Value


For DBQL logging, detail logging is the default on VantageCloud Lake. For users or accounts running tactical workloads, the recommendation is to enable DBQL Summary/Threshold logging, so the logging volume will be nominal. The summary log can be accessed using td_metric_svc.dbqlsummaryV.
