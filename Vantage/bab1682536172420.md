This is a short paragraph. The following passthru value should print up exactly the markdown equivalent of what normally is an xref conref (referable-content) of this linktext 'Read more', enclosed in regular brackets, followed immediately by the url to the What's New topic on Fluto for VCL, enclosed in parens: `[Read more](https://docs.teradata.com/r/Teradata-VantageCloud-Lake/What-s-New/March-2023)`.

## Section Title first child


This is an equally short paragraph. The following passthru value should print up exactly the markdown equivalent of what normally is the button specialization of data, available through the **LwDITA (IPH Only)**. On reflection, this element also is better handled as a data conref because it contains a reference to a common ui element in the UI. Conreffing the content would allow an architect to single-source and globally change linktext 'LAUNCH EDITOR' or to assign a different id if that also changed. Finally, a conreffed version of the content makes it easier for the content developer to find just the right button from available button conrefs, instead of copying and pasting the code.

The following has linktext 'LAUNCH EDITOR', enclosed in regular brackets, followed immediately by a name-value pair listing the action and target of action, enclosed in parens: `[LAUNCH EDITOR](\#data=\{&quot;navigateTo&quot;:&quot;editor&quot;\})`

## Section Title sibling of first child


This paragraph is followed by a different passthrough value to allow testing of disable-output-escaping attribute and normalize-space functions of the atomic value. disable-output-escaping is likely to break the xml if applied in an intermediate xml transform (normalize-inline-metadata.xsl). Apply disable-output-escaping to the xml during the xml to markdown phase (ast2markdown.td.xsl).

The passthru is the following: `Non-escapable characters, with character immediately followed by its name: *asterisk _underscore [left bracket ]right bracket (left paren )right paren >greater-than`

Not sure what this extra section is supposed to be testing. Maybe whether adding another section appears in TOC?
