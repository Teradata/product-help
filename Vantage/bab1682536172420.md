## Third Party Applications (AWS)


The integration of Third Party Applications with VantageCloud Lake is now enhanced to support SAS installation using VantageCloud Lake Console. SAS seamlessly integrates with Teradata and provides efficient data management and analytics capabilities. By using SAS Embedded Process (SAS EP), users can run SAS programs directly within the Analytics Database, enhancing the overall analytics experience. With features like SAS Scoring Accelerator and SAS In-Database Code Accelerator, users can optimize their data processing and analysis workflows.
