# Compute Groups


Separate compute clusters of BYNET-connected nodes independent of the POG. They perform compute-intensive query steps that must access TSS (such as analytic functions), freeing the POG to perform session management, parsing engine, and tactical or other short-term work.

Characteristics:

-   May be specialized.

-   Extend and automatically scale up compute power.

-   Donâ€™t have permanent data.

-   Can read large tables in TSS.

-   Can hold intermediate data, keeping it in memory or in internal drives.

-   100% fault-isolated from system-wide failures.

-   Independently upgradable to newer versions of software without disrupting the rest of the system.
