Selecting a character set enables translation codes on the VantageCloud Lake system. The translation codes convert your character data to the applicable default server character set.

There are two categories of the character sets in a Vantage environment:

-   Client (session) character set: Used when you sign on and make requests to the database or when the database returns data to you.


-   Server or internal (database) character set: Used by the database to store user data.


The default server character sets are LATIN or UNICODE in VantageCloud Lake. The default server character set can be overridden for a specific user or table columns.

Specifying the default client character set (session character set) identifies to Analytics Database what translation codes to use when converting the client request into the server character set for processing, and when returning an answer set to client.

The requirements for using client character sets vary by character set.
