A share admin manages users and roles that work with shared data. At least one user must be assigned as the share admin.

Expand the navigation panel to access **Permissions** under **Data Sharing**.

The following roles are available:

-   **Citizen**: Assigned by a share admin. Once you become a citizen, you can request subscriptions to available shares.

-   **Provider**: Assigned by a share admin. Grants subscription requests by citizens. You must be assigned the citizen role before being assigned a provider role.

-   **Admin**- Assigned by a DBA or another share admin. Manage data sharing administrative activities.

|Create shares|–|Yes|Yes|
|List and view shares|Yes|Yes|Yes|
|Delete shares|–|Yes|Yes|
|Add or remove providers, citizens, or share admins|–|–|Yes|


**Providers can only manage shares they create.*

All individual users must be a citizen first before becoming a provider or admin. User roles can be modified later in time. Role privileges default to **Citizen** and cannot be modified.
