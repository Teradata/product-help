A share admin manages users and roles that work with shared data. There must be at least one user assigned as the share admin.

Expand the navigation panel to access the **Permissions** page under **Data Sharing**.

The following roles are available for data sharing:

-   **Citizen** - assigned by the share admin. Once you become a citizen, you can request subscriptions to available shares.

-   **Provider** - assigned by the share admin. Providers grants subscription requests by citizens. You must be assigned the citizen role before being assigned a provider role.

-   **Admin** - assigned by a DBA or another share admin. Share admins manage data sharing administrative activities.

|List and view shares|Yes|Yes|Yes|
