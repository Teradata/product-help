A share admin manages users and roles that work with shared data. At least one user must be assigned as the share admin.

Expand the navigation panel to access **Permissions** under **Data Sharing**.

The following roles are available:

-   **Citizen**: Assigned by a share admin. Once you become a citizen, you can request subscriptions to available shares.

-   **Provider**: Assigned by a share admin. Grants subscription requests by citizens. You must be assigned the citizen role before being assigned a provider role.

-   **Admin**: Assigned by a DBA or another share admin. Manage data sharing administrative activities.
