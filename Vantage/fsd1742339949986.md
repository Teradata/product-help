**Note:** Vector store in the VantageCloud Lake console is for AWS only.

A vector store is a specialized database designed to store and manage high-dimensional *vectors*, that is, numerical representations of data like text, images, or user behavior. Rather than rely on exact keyword matches, vector stores use a semantic search by storing data as vectors.

Key uses of a vector store:

-   Semantic search and retrieval

    Search content based on meaning, not just keywords. For example, if you ask a question in natural language, the system can pull relevant documents even if the documents don't contain the exact words in the query.


-   AI-assisted content discovery

    Generate FAQ or Q&A documents and knowledge-based enrichment content.


-   Scalability

    Search millions of vectors, making it suitable for large content repositories.


-   Easily manage semantic search capabilities

    Create, edit, delete, and run administrative tasks easily with vector stores.


An organization admin must first enable the vector store for your environment. From the home page, select an environment > **Settings > Vector store > Enable**.

You must be a database user to create and access vector stores.
