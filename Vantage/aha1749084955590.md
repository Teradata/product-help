**Distance metric**

Defines how similarity is calculated between vectors:

-   **Cosine similarity**

    Measures angle between vectors; ideal for text embeddings.


-   **Euclidean distance**

    Measures straight-line distance; useful for spatial or geometric data.

    **Tip:** Match your scoring strategy to the embedding model used during vector generation.


-   **Dot product**

    Emphasizes magnitude and direction; often used in deep learning.
