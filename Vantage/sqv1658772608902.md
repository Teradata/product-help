Compute groups have these characteristics:

-   With no service interruption, they can be started to accommodate bigger workloads and stopped when no longer needed (to lower costs).

-   You can create them for specific entities (departments, applications, or projects), and then segregate processing, monitoring, reporting, and billing by entity.

-   You can associate each department with its own group of compute clusters, which lets you isolate each department's work and costs.

-   They are ideal for periodic, predictable, special-purpose tasks, such as month-end processing, exploration, and projects.
