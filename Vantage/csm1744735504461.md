When checked allows the restore to run as a copy job.

-   A copy job assumes the destination database is not the original database system on the backup job and the database ID is different.


-   A copy job is used when restoring to a database with a different internal database ID than the one in the backup save set.


**Note:** Do not use **Run as copy** when the database system is the original database and the database ID matches the one found in the backup save set.
