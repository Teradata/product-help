You can have a restore job automatically run again if a restore backup job fails by selecting **Run as copy** in the advanced restore job settings.

Take the following actions occur when a restore backup job fails:

-   **Table level restore**

    If a table-level object doesn't exist on the target system, the object is recreated on the target database with a new ID when **Run as copy** is selected in the job settings.


-   **Database level restore**

    If the database exists on the target system but objects are missing from the database, use **Restore** to restore those objects with the same ID as in the backup.


-   **Database level jobs**

    If the database is missing from the target system, first create the database object on the target system and then use the **Run as copy** option in the job settings.
