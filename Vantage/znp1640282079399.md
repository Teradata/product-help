Connecting a data source in QueryGrid is a four-step process. You cannot move forward without completing each step fully.

## Select data source


Enter the information in the required fields to connect a data source to QueryGrid.

-   Fields with an asterisk are required.

-   Selecting a data source type other than Teradata displays fields to connect to the Amazon EMR Hive or Spark connectors.

-   Some fields are dynamic, such as when selecting **Use bridge** and **Use user mapping** where one or the other must be selected.

-   Select the calculator to estimate memory per node.


## Register nodes


Register all of your data source nodes with QueryGrid Manager. You can can register existing or new nodes.

## Network diagnostics


Run a test to verify that the connection between all the nodes of your data source are working.

If the test fails, check that the endpoint address is correct.

## Authorization


Setup access between the systems by creating foreign servers between the two systems.

Enter the user credentials for both the target and initiator databases.
