Connecting a data source in QueryGrid is a four-step process. You cannot move forward without completing each step fully.

## Select data source


Enter the information in the required fields to connect a data source to QueryGrid.

-   Fields with an asterisk are required.

-   Selecting a data source type other than Teradata displays fields to connect to the Amazon EMR Hive or Spark connectors.

-   Some fields are dynamic, such as when selecting **Use bridge** and **Use user mapping**.

-   Select the calculator icon [do I have this graphic????] to estimate memory per node.


## Register nodes


Register all of your data source nodes with QueryGrid Manager. You can can register existing or new nodes.

[do we need AWS EMR information to add here???? is this where you find the download packages to install? ]

## Network diagnostics


Run a test to verify that the connection between all the nodes of your data source are working.

If the test fails, check that the data source information and login credentials are correct.

## Authorization


Setup access between the systems by creating foreign servers between the two systems.

[what is the difference between service acct name and user credentials? Is that the AWS service vs the non-Lake admin (such as Core or Enterprise)???] Once established, do they need to re-add these credentials again - outside of maybe modifying something?]
