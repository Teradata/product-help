Connecting a data source in QueryGrid is a four-step process. You cannot move forward without completing each step.

## Select data source


Enter the information in the required fields to connect a data source to QueryGrid.

-   Fields with an asterisk are required.

-   Selecting a data source type other than Teradata displays fields to connect to the Amazon EMR Hive or Spark connectors.

-   Some fields are dynamic, such as when selecting **Use bridge** and **Use user mapping** where one or the other must be selected.

-   Select the calculator to estimate memory per node.


## Register nodes


Register all of your data source nodes with QueryGrid Manager. You can can register existing or new nodes.

## Network diagnostics


Run a test to verify that the connection between all the nodes of your data source are working.

If the test fails, check that the endpoint address is correct.

## Authorization


Setup access between the systems by creating foreign servers between the two systems.

Admin credentials must be entered for both the target and initiator systems. You can use the DBC user. If you do not want to use the DBC user, then a QG_ADMIN user can be created for QueryGrid setup.
