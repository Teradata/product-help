Connecting a data source in QueryGrid is a four-step process. You cannot move forward without completing each step.

## 1 Select data source


Enter the information in the required fields to connect a data source to QueryGrid.

-   Fields with an asterisk are required.

-   Selecting a data source type other than Teradata displays fields to connect to the Amazon EMR (Hive or Spark) or the Generic JDBC connectors.

-   Some fields are dynamic, such as when selecting **Use bridge** and **Use user mapping** where one or the other must be selected.

-   Select the calculator to estimate memory per node.

-   Driver nodes must be able to open a JDBC connection to the query engines. Teradata recommends selecting only master nodes as driver nodes because they are known to have a connection as compared to data nodes.


## 2 Register nodes


Register all of your target system nodes with QueryGrid Manager. You can register existing or new nodes.

**Note:** To untar the QueryGrid package and get the rpm, use the command `tar-xvzf tdqg-node.tar.gz` when registering the Teradata node.

## 3 Network diagnostics


Run a test to verify that the connection between all the nodes of your data source are working.

If the test fails, check that the endpoint address is correct. The error message also contains information about what connection could not be established and why.

## 4 Authorization


Setup access between the systems by creating foreign servers between the two systems.

Admin credentials must be entered for both the target and initiator systems. You can use the DBC user credentials. If you do not want to use the DBC user, then a QG_ADMIN user can be created for QueryGrid setup.
