When first installed, the Analytics Database has only one user, DBC. Other databases and users in the system are created from DBC.

The default environment **Username** is DBC. The DBC user is the DBA (group administrator) of the environment and has root access to the database. You can create additional [database users](wxe1659392685092.md) with different roles and permissions later.

Create a unique password for DBC, following the password requirements.

**Important!** Safeguard your credentials. You will need the root password for creating the first database administrator..
