As a db_user, you can create and manage copy plans.

A copy plan defines the objects to copy from a source to a target database. There is no limit to how many copy plans you can have. You can set up to 20 copy plans to run concurrently, but only 5 tables are copied at a time.

Copy plans are run manually, they can not be scheduled.
