When creating an environment or creating or editing a compute profile, consumption is automatically estimated based on your selections.

## Term


-   **Term**: Current contracted time period for your company.


-   **Committed units**: Total units available in the contracted term.


-   **Spent**: Units already consumed in the term.


-   **Already allocated**: Units projected to be used in the term.


-   **New spend**: Projected units to be used based on your primary cluster instance size or compute cluster size changes.


-   **Remaining**: Remaining committed units for the term. If negative, you are now paying for units on a month-to-month basis.


## Max per


Select from the **Max per** menu to view the maximum consumption estimate per day, week, month, or year. As you make changes to the primary cluster or compute profile, the estimates update automatically for the following values:

-   Hours active per day


-   Units per hour


-   Instance count


-   Days in <week, month, year>


-   <Daily, weekly, monthly, yearly> consumption
