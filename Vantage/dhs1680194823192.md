Get the metadata file from your SAML identity provider portal. Do this by creating an application in your identity provider portal. Use these two values:

-   Entity ID - This is your VantageCloud Lake base URL. For example, https://*yourcompany*.innovationlabs.teradata.com.

-   ACS URL - This is your VantageCloud Lake base URL + /auth/sp/ACS.saml2. For example, https://*yourcompany*.innovationlabs.teradata.com/auth/sp/ACS.saml2.


You also need the claims from your identity provider to map to these VantageCloud Lake claims:

-   groups

-   given_name

-   display_name

-   family_name

-   email

-   username


**Important!** After you select **Add Provider**, add the certificate to your identity provider configuration in your identity provider portal.
