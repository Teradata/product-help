**Note:** Some options may be pre-selected or unavailable in a VantageCloud Lake trial environment.

As an organization admin, you can create environments once your organization is established in VantageCloud Lake.

**Tip:** Refer to the pre-installation sizing exercise done with your Teradata representative to help create your environment.

Each environment contains a **primary cluster**, a group of connected nodes, which serve as the hub for your environment. The **primary cluster** provides connectivity, query planning, and database resources for your users. Your organization may use multiple environments, such as separate environments for different teams in your organization.

You can also optionally create scalable **compute groups** for environments. Compute groups provide resources to specific departments, applications, or projects for separate processing, monitoring, or billing.

When you create an environment, VantageCloud Lake dynamically calculates the estimated consumption in the **Consumption estimates** area so you can see how your selections affect cost as you change the environment settings.
