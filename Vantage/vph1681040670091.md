A subscriber is an individual user or group role that has access to all the datasets in a share.

As a provider, you can [add subscribers](hdx1681040827922.md) to the shares you own. If a user or role is not listed in the **Add users** or **Add roles** sidesheets, contact the share admin to assign them the citizen role.

Subscriber names are case-sensitive.

When users are added to a role containing the citizen role, the user is automatically able to view the shares that are subscribed to that role.
