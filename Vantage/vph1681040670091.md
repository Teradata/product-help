A subscriber is a user or role that has access to all the datasets in a share.

As a provider, you can [add subscribers](hdx1681040827922.md) to the shares you own. If a user or role is not listed, contact the share admin to assign them the citizen role.

Subscriber names are case-sensitive.

When a user is added to a role containing the citizen role, that user is automatically able to view the shares the role is subscribed to.
