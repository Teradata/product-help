### Policy Server (ServiceConnect on CMIC only)

A policy server allows the customer to control remote access through ServiceConnect. This functionality must be acquired from Teradata, and then **enabled**.

**Host** - The Host IP address or name of the policy server.

**Port** - 8009

**Use SSL** - SSL helps secure the connection. Enter a cipher suites name or All, then validate.

**HTTP Proxy or SOCKS Proxy** - If the gateway is going through an HTTP or SOCKS proxy server, enable it, enter the host IP address or name, and the port of the HTTP/SOCKS proxy configuration.

To require proxy credentials, select **Use Authentication Credentials**, and enter the username and password.
