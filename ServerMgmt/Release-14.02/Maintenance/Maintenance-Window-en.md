### Maintenance Window

Open a maintenance window before performing any task that generates alerts.

Maintenance windows:

- Provide a change history.
- Suppress incident creation for systems using Teradata ServiceConnect with Auto Incident Create enabled.

A maintenance window automatically closes when the time expires, or you can close it manually.
