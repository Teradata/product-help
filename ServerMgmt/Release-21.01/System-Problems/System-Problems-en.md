### System Problems

PSIMs collect events from managed nodes and correlate them to provide an overoll problem summary.

**Events** - A system condition change that may require attention.

**Alerts** - Events that affect system operation. The severity indicates the impact.

**Summary Alerts/System Problem** - A group of alerts that all occur during a system incident. Close system problems once the problem conditions are resolved
