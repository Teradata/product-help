### System Problems

The CMIC collects events for the components it manages, then correlates them with other CMICs to provide a status summary of the domain.

**Events** - A system condition change that may require attention.

**Alerts** - Events that affect system operation. The severity indicates the impact. Alerts can be generated for hardware, software, Kubernetes clusters, etc.

**Summary Alerts/System Problem** - A group of alerts that all occur during a system incident. Close system problems once the problem conditions are resolved
