### Remote Access (ServiceConnect on CMIC only)

Remote Access allows Teradata analysts to connect securely to specific devices through ServiceConnect.

Configure remote access devices during the initial ServiceConnect configuration based on the managed components in the domain (including a connection to the SWS, if one is available). Configure each gateway similarly to make the remote connection available on redundant gateways from the Enterprise Server.

At Model, use the default device name if possible. Otherwise, make sure the name starts with the SiteID and describes the connection endpoint or device model.
