### Proxy Server (ServiceConnect on CMIC only)

A proxy server allows the customer to require outgoing communication to be routed through their server. To use a proxy server, it must be enabled.

**Configuration File URL** - The URL of the site-specific configuration file. Initially, this is an IP address and port number. However, once you've done custom configurations outside the Teradata UI, this can be a hostname instead.

**HTTP Proxy or SOCKS Proxy** - If the gateway is going through an HTTP or SOCKS proxy server, enable it, enter the host IP address or name, and the port of the HTTP/SOCKS proxy configuration.

To require proxy credentials, select **Use Authentication Credentials**, and enter the username and password.
