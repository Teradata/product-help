### Viewpoint Configuration

Define up to five Viewpoint servers to receive alerts so they can be represented in the Teradata Alerts view and trigger notifications through Viewpoint's Common Alerting services. Using a Viewpoint server within the Server Management domain gives all CMICs equal access to the server in the event of a CMIC failover.
