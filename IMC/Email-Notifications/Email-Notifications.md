### Getting Email Notifications

You can configure and receive notifications at the email address for the account you logged on with. Email notifications contain a digest of the notification events you choose to receive. You won't receive any email notifications unless you set them, and you can change your choices at any time. 

Notifications display in the notification hub regardless of whether or not you configure email notifications.

1. Under Global, turn on **Allow email notifications**.
1. Work through the page, enabling the notifications you want.
