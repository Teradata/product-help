### Vantage Units

Vantage Units reflect all compute resources used to run queries and functions, measured to the millisecond and collected hourly. They don't include queries and functions that:
- Monitor the system
- Measure system performance or consumption
- Don't return a result due to a system error or failure

You can export Vantage Unit data to .csv format by selecting the export button.

Select **Vantage Units Details** to filter by engine, period, and department and to see the 10 queries that consumed the most Vantage Units.
