### Site Elasticity

Site Admins or Super Site Admins can click CHANGE in the NewSQL Engine window to adjust site elasticity.
Be aware that your site is not available during elastic options. Schedule this at a time that minimally impacts your users.

#### Start/Stop
Start or stop the database. Stopped instances do not incur compute costs, but they continue to incur storage costs (measured in TB).

#### Scale Up/Down
Adjust the instance size. Just be aware that scaling up incurs more cost.

#### Scale Out/In
Adjust the your instance quantity. Scaling out incurs additional cost.

#### Expand Storage
Increase the amount of raw, permanent storage in your system by 1 TB increments, up to 64 TB per instance.
