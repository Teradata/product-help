### Advanced SQL Engine Operations

Site Admins and Super Site Admins can select **Change** to perform SQL Engine operations.

Keep in mind that:

- Your site isn't available during these operations, so schedule them at a time that minimally impacts users.
- Scaling up or out and expanding volume may incur additional costs.
- Once you expand storage volume you can't decrease it.
