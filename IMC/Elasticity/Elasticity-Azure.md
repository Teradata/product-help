### Advanced SQL Engine

Site Admins and Super Site Admins can select **Change** to perform SQL Engine operations, such as starting and stopping the database and scaling the instance size.

Keep in mind that:

- Your site isn't available during these operations, so schedule them at a time that minimally impacts users.
- Scaling up or out and expanding volume may incur additional costs.
- After you expand storage volume you can't decrease it.

**Tip**: The icon in the Advanced SQL Engine card stops spinning when the operation finishes.
