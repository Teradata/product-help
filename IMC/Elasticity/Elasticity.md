### Site Elasticity

Site Admins or Super Site Admins can click **Edit** in the **NewSQL Engine** window to adjust site elasticity.

Be aware that your site is not available during elastic options. Schedule this at a time that minimally impacts your users.

#### Start and Stop

You can adjust your TCore consumption by starting and stopping the Vantage instance. Stopped instances do not incur TCore, computer, or memory costs, but they continue to incur storage costs.

#### Scale up and Scale Down

You can scale up or down your instance to **Small**, **Medium**, or **Large**. Just be aware that scaling up incurs more cost.

#### Expand Volume

You can expand the amount of raw, permanent storage in your system by 1 TB increments, up to 72 TB per instance. Once you expand storage, you cannot decrease it.
