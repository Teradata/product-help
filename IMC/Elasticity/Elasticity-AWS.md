### Site Elasticity

Site Admins or Super Site Admins can click **Edit** in the **NewSQL Engine** window to adjust site elasticity.

Be aware that your site is not available during elastic options. Schedule this at a time that minimally impacts your users.

#### Start/Stop

Adjust your TCore consumption by starting and stopping the Vantage instance. Stopped instances do not incur TCore, computer, or memory costs, but they continue to incur storage costs.

#### Scale Up/Down

Scale up or down your instance to **Small**, **Medium**, or **Large**. Just be aware that scaling up incurs more cost.

#### Node Operations

Adjust your instance quantity by 1x, 2x, or 4x for a total of 2-64 nodes. Scaling out incurs additional cost.

#### Expand Volume

Increase the amount of raw, permanent storage (EBS) in your system by 1 TB increments, up to 72 TB per instance. Once you expand storage, you cannot decrease it.
