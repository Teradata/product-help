### Incidents

Site Admins and Super Site Admins can open incidents for three reasons: 

- [Overview](#overview)
- [Report a problem/Open an Incident](#report-problem-/-open-an-incident) 
- [Request a Change](#request-a-change)
- [Ask a Question](#ask-a-question)

#### Overview

Site Admins and Super Site Admins can create an incident. 

Incidents you create in the Console are the same as incidents you create in the Service Portal. The Console provides a streamlined way to manage your incidents.

Teradata responds to incidents based on severity ranking.

**Note**: Vantage Trial users create incidents only through the Console.

#### Report a Problem/Open an Incident

Report a problem that is preventing or downgrading service. 

The **Impact** and **Urgency** options include the following:

| Severity Ranking | Impact | Urgency | Description |

If they aren't available, Teradata changes the incident to S2. |
| **2** | **Significant** | **High** | Production system is up and operational, but the incident has severe, ongoing, daily impact to operations; a non-mission critical system is down and requires expedited engagement and urgent resolution. |
