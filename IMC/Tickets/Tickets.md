### Tickets

The console allows Site Admins or Super Site Admins to open tickets for three reasons: 

- [Report a problem or incident](#report-a-problem-or-incident) 
- [Request a change](#request-a-change)
- [Ask a question](#ask-a-question)

Tickets you create in the console are no different than normal system tickets. The console just provides a streamlined way to manage them.

#### Report a Problem or Incident

1. Select **Report a Problem/Open an Incident**.
1. At **Impact**, select:

     - **Critical** for S1 incidents, where a production system is down or degraded. requiring immediate attention. Note that critical tickets require Teradata to contact you immediately. If you are not available, Teradata downgrades the incident.
      
     - **Significant** when a production system is operational, but a problem is causing a severe impact. Also select this when a non-production system is down.
     - **Minor** for all other incidents. 
1. At **Urgency**, select how quickly the problem must be resolved: immediately, next business day, or within a few days. Urgency and Impact work together to help Teradata address your issue appropriately.  
1. Select the **Database Site Impacted**, then tell us what's going wrong. 
1. Submit the ticket. 

#### Request a Change

1. Select **Request a Change**.
1. Select a **Priority** based on how much your business needs this change.

1. Submit the ticket.

#### Ask a Question
