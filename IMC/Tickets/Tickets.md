### Tickets

Site Admins and Super Site Admins can open tickets for three reasons: 

- [Reporting a problem or incident](#report-a-problem-or-incident) 
- [Requesting a change](#request-a-change)
- [Submitting a question](#ask-a-question)

Tickets you create in the Console are no different than those you create in the Service Portal. The Console just provides a streamlined way to manage them.

#### Reporting a Problem or Incident

1. On the **Support Tickets** screen, select **Create Ticket**.
1. At **Request Type**, select **Report a Problem/Open an Incident**.
1. At **Impact**, select:

     - **Critical** for S1 incidents, where a production system is down or degraded and needs immediate attention. Critical tickets require Teradata to contact you immediately. If you're not available, Teradata downgrades the incident.
      
     - **Significant** when a production system is operational but a problem is causing a severe impact. Also select this when a non-production system is down.
     - **Minor** for all other incidents. 
1. At **Urgency**, select how quickly the problem must be resolved: immediately, next business day, or within a few days. Teradata considers both Urgency and Impact to address your issue appropriately.  
1. Select the **Database Site Impacted**, then tell us what's wrong. 
1. Submit the ticket. 

#### Requesting a Change

1. On the **Support Tickets** screen, select **Create Ticket**.
1. At **Request Type**, select **Request a Change**.
1. Select a **Priority** based on how much your business needs this change.
1. Describe the change you want. Be as specific as possible.
1. Submit the ticket.

#### Submitting a Question

1. On the **Support Tickets** screen, select **Create Ticket**.
1. At **Request Type**, select **Ask a Question**.
1. Tell us what's on your mind. Remember, Teradata treats questions as S4 severity and you may not hear back for several days or longer.
