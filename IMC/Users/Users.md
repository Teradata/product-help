#### Changing your User Role

You can change your user role to any other role for which you have permissions.

If the role you need does not appear in the list, request access to it in the Service Portal.

If you need additional permissions, request a new role in the Service Portal.
1. Log in to the Service Portal at https://support.teradatacloud.com.
2. Under Service Requests, select Request Access to Service.
3. Select a user.

Once the Site Access Manager approves the request you are associated with the new role in the Console.
