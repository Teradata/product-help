### Generate S3 Bucket Policy

Your Cloud admin may enforce stricter policies on your S3 bucket requests originating from external sources. Therefore, granting access to your S3 bucket from your Vantage Trial instance may require an additional policy code snippet. 

Click **Register Storage** to use an existing S3 bucket in your account.  Enter the URI of the existing bucket, and click Submit to generate the S3 bucket policy.

Click **Copy Policy** to copy an existing S3 bucket policy to the clipboard to edit.

Click **Test Connection** to confirm the read and write permissions work.
