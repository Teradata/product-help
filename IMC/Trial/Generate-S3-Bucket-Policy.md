### Generate S3 Bucket Policy

Your Cloud admin may enforce stricter policies on your S3 bucket requests originating from external sources. Therefore, granting access to the S3 bucket may require an additional policy.

Click **Register Storage** to use an existing S3 bucket in your account.  Enter the URI of the existing bucket, and click Submit to generate the S3 bucket policy.

Click **Copy Policy** to copy an existing policy to the clipboard to edit.

Click **Test Connection** to confirm the read and write permissions work.
