### TCore-Hours Info

A TCore is a metric used to price Teradata Vantage software. TCores are CPU cores potential based on I/O capacity. The TCore metric provides a consistent measurement of a system configuration that takes the number of cores available and discounts that by the I/O available to keep the cores busy. 

TCore-Hours is a metric that represents the availability of TCores on the underlying infrastructure, by the hour.

In Vantage Trial, Teradata provides free credits in the form of a block of TCore-Hours. Teradata uses this metric to provide you with a limited capacity of 10,000 TCore-Hours during the trial. The rate of TCore-Hours consumed/consumption depends on the number, type, and TCore ratings of provisioned instances. When your TCore-Hours end your trial is over even if the number of calendar days is not exhausted.
