### Restore Snapshot

To restore an existing snapshot to the system:

1. Stop the database.
1. Select the snapshot from the retained copies, and click 
![Kebob](more_vert_kebob-15px.svg) > Restore.
1. Confirm that **Compatibility** is green.
1. Check the box to acknowledge that the snapshot will delete all data added since the selected snapshot was taken.
1. Check the box to acknowledge the target system will be unavailable during the snapshot process.
1. Click **Restore**.

Restoring a snapshot takes much longer than creating it. Also, the process may not start immediately after you click **Restore**.
