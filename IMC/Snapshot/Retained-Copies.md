### Retained Copies

These are the retained snapshots available to restore.

Retained snapshots result in recurring storage costs

Click 
![Kebob](more_vert_kebob-15px.svg) and: 

- **Rename** to give your snapshot a more meaningful name.
- **Restore** to restore the snapshot to the system, overriding any existing content. Some installations step you through the restore process; others open an incident for Teradata to do the restore.
- **Delete** to remove the snapshot permanently.
