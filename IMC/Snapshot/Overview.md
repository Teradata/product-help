### Snapshots

Snapshots are full-system backups used for data protection. They allow you to perform a full system backup and restore data into target public cloud Teradata systems with minimal downtime.

Snapshots cannot perform object-level backups.

Click **Manage** to create, rename, or restore snapshot copies.

Caution: Do not perform ETL operations while creating a snapshot to maintain data integrity and avoid extended recovery times.
