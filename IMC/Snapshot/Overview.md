### Snapshots

Snapshots are full-system backups used for data protection and DR. They allow you to perform a full system backup and restore data into target public cloud Teradata systems with minimal downtime.

Snapshots cannot perform object-level backups.

Click **Manage** to create, rename, or restore snapshot copies.

Caution: Snapshots interfere with any backup or other ETL operations that are running or scheduled to occur while the snapshot is in progress.
