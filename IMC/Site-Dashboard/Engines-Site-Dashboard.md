# Engines

Displays the current status of the engines. 
- A green icon indicates the engine is healthy and running.
- A red icon indicates the engine is stopped, generally due to a maintenance window.

 Admins and Super Site Admins can manage backup jobs by selecting CONFIGURE ENGINES > BACKUPS and then the overflow menu for the job.
