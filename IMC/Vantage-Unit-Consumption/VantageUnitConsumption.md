### PrivateLink

AWS PrivateLink lets you access AWS and third-party services hosted within AWS privately and securely. Add AWS accounts to allow traffic between your Virtual Private Cloud (VPC) and your Vantage site.

After you add an account, you must set up an AWS service endpoint for it using the Amazon VPC console.
