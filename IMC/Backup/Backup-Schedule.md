### Backup Schedule

The backup jobs scheduled to run.

Click + to add a schedule.

When scheduling a backup:

- Select whether you want a full or incremental backup. Note that the first time you run a job is a full backup, even if you select incremental.
- Select the dates and times you want the backup operation to run.
- Note that times are in UTC.
- If you select **Last Day of Month**, you cannot select any other days. In that case, you'd have to create two backup jobs.

When you add a new schedule, the system warns you of conflicts with other schedules. Failure to correct those could result in skipped backups, or other issues.
