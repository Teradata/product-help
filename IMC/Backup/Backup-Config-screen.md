### Backups

#### Managing Backups

1. Turn a backup job on or off by selecting or deselecting the toggle in the job list.
2. Select the overflow menu and then:
- **Job Overview** to see high-level details of the job, and abort a running backup job.

- **Edit Job** to modify the backup job's schedule. 

You must submit a ticket to:
