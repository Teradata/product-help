Displays the previous backup jobs that have run or failed.

Click 
![more_vert_kebob-15px.svg](more_vert_kebob-15px.svg) > **Mark Protected** to protect a backup job. Protected jobs are not deleted.

At least one backup must remain unprotected for subsequent runs. If you only keep two backups, and one is protected, you must confirm your choice to designate a new protected backup.

For example, if you run a backup on the last day of the month, you may choose to protect that copy, and then replace the daily backup whenever it runs.
