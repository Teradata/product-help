As an organization admin, you can set up a disaster recovery solution with a dedicated disaster recovery site in a different region. This safeguards your data by replicating it in another region to keep business continuity. You can perform failover for planned or unplanned disaster recovery tests or events.

Disaster recovery supports Teradata block storage and OFS storage.
