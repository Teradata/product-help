### This is what Headng 3 looks like.
This text has no heading level applied.

1. First item in a numbered list.
1. Second item in a numbered list.
1. Third item in a numbered list.

Now I'll try a bulleted list of Cloud team members:

- Beth
- Alanna
- Chuck
- Lynn

I skipped a line after the bulleted list.

Now I'll try inserting a table.



| Fruit |Color  | Cost per Piece |
|--|--|--|
|Apple  | Red | $.65 |
| Banana|Yellow  | $.25 |
| Orange | Orange! |  $.45|
  |

It seems the default is 3 columns. I'll try deleting the right one manually.

| Fruit |Color  |
|--|--|
|Apple  | Red 
| Banana|Yellow 
| Orange | Orange! 
  |
  
  Now I'll try to check this puppy in!
