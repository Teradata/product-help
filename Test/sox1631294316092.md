# Queries


Review current or completed queries for the selected **Account**.

Select ![""](Images/osi1486663214906.gif) to view or edit a specific query.

Testing sub-links (these don't work):

-   Current: [Current](sox1631294316092.md#)

-   Completed: [Completed](sox1631294316092.md#)


But these do:

-   Current: [Click here to go to the Completed section](#Current)

-   Completed:[Completed](#Completed)


## Current


Review the list of current queries, and optionally filter query columns.

Select ![img alt=“”](Images/ppy1633638332163.png) to see more details about the current query, copy the SQL, open the query in Editor, or cancel the query.

### Completed


Almost completed.

You can also use the Web client to edit the topic, and use the IPH right-click menu. `Here is text that should format in the Web client with monospace type.`
