You connect to an environment as a database user.

At the top-left of the **Editor**, select the down arrow. Then connect one of the following ways:

-   Add a connection by entering your account credentials.

-   Select a recently used connection, if available.


You can make one environment connection your default.

Once you are connected, all the databases that you have permission to use appear. You can make one your default.

To end the connection and remove it from the drop-down list, select **Remove**.
