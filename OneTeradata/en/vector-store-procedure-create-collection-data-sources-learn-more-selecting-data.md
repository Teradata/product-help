You can create vector collections from a wide variety of data types:         

- Text and Documents: This includes plain text files, articles, books, user reviews, customer feedback, and internal documentation (e.g., from Confluence or Jira). These are often used for semantic search and Retrieval Augmented Generation (RAG) applications in AI.
- Images and Video: Feature extraction algorithms and deep learning networks can process images and video frames to create embeddings for visual search, content moderation, and facial recognition.
- Structured or Tabular Data: Numerical features from databases (like user preferences, product characteristics, or transaction data) can be converted into vectors for recommendation systems, fraud detection, and anomaly detection.
