You can choose either Basic or SherpaLLM for your vector collection.

- Basic: Select if your documents are straightforward, such as, contracts and policy documents due to its efficiency.

Note: You may have split sentences or structure loss in complex documents.

- SherpaLLM: Select if your documents are more complex, multi-step tasks needing structured workflows, like advanced code generation or data extraction from PDFs with tables/graphs

Note: Irregular formats or images may not give accurate chunking.
