To choose an embedding model for your vector collection, first define your domain, language, task, and then shortlist models using benchmarks. 

Once done, test the models on your data for retrieval quality, balancing performance (accuracy, speed) with infrastructure costs (dimensions, size, latency, throughput) to find the best fit for your application. 

Start general, iterate, and consider fine-tuning or smaller models for specific needs.
