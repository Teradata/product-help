You can create and share documents containing live code, equations, visualizations, and narrative text similar to using Jupyter Notebooks. Notebooks are used in data science, machine learning, and technical documentation. You can:

- Write and run code in small chunks
- Use multiple programming languages (such as Python)
- Integrate charts, graphs, and plots using libraries (such as, Matplotlib, Seaborn, or Plotly)
- Combine markdown text with code to create readable workflows
- Present data analysis and model results
- Create tutorials, technical guides, and reproducible research
- Enable version control and share for team reproduction and validation
- Use in conjunction with AI/ML platforms (such as TensorFlow, PyTorch, and Teradata AI Factory)
