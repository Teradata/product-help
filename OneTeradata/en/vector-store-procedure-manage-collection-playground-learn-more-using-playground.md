The playground allows you test your vector collection and assess the accuracy of the results, 

If required, you can modify the chunking methods, embedding models, search threshold, chat completion models in the vector collection settings to increase the accuracy of the top K results. Ideally, the results should be an actual natural language response based on the top K results using the specified chat completion model.
