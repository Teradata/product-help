Teradata Vector Collections supports a variety of algorithms for indexing and searching within vector stores:   

- VectorDistance: The TD_VectorDistance function computes the similarity or dissimilarity between two vectors in a multi-dimensional space.
- KMeans: The k-means algorithm groups observations into k clusters, assigning each observation to the nearest cluster centroid. This facilitates clustering and efficient retrieval of similar data.
- HNSW (Hierarchical Navigable Small World): A graph-based algorithm enabling approximate nearest neighbour search, allowing for fast and scalable retrieval in large vector databases.
