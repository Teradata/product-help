Chunking is the process of breaking down large documents or data into smaller, manageable, and semantically meaningful pieces called Chunks

 Select either Basic for simple documents or SherpaLLM for complex documents with tables and images.

- Basic: Simple, fixed-size or recursive splitting methods.
- SherpalLLM: Advanced, context-aware approach that leverages document structure and semantics to create more meaningful chunks for better retrieval-augmented generation (RAG) performance.

By default, each chunk is of size 512 characters. If required, you can change this chunk size.

While changing the chunk size, you can also select header and/or footer or up to 1000 pixels.
