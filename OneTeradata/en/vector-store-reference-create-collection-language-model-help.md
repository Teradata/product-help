The language models (also known as chat models) are used to create a natural language response during retrieval. When you ask a natural language question to the data, the Language Model uses the topK results returned by the efficient search algorithm and gives an accurate natural language response.

You can select AWS Model or select later. If you select AWS model, you can choose between Anthropic Claude 3 Haiku or Anthropic Claude 3.5 Sonnet.
