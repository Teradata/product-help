An embedding model converts text, images, or audio into numerical vectors that represent meaning.  
These vectors are stored in a vector database, allowing AI to find semantically similar items using mathematical comparisons.  
This enables features like semantic search, recommendations, and [RAG](https://aws.amazon.com/what-is/retrieval-augmented-generation/).  
By learning from data, the model places similar concepts close together, helping computers understand context beyond keywords.
