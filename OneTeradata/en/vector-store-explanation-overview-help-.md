A vector store is a specialized database designed to store and manage high-dimensional vectors, that is, numerical representations of data like text, images, or user behavior. Rather than rely on exact keyword matches, vector stores use a semantic search by storing data as vectors. 

Key uses of a vector store: 

- Semantic search and retrieval    
Search content based on meaning, not just keywords. For example, if you ask a question in natural language, the system can pull relevant documents even if the documents don't contain the exact words in the query.
- AI-assisted content discovery    
Generate FAQ or Q&A documents and knowledge-based enrichment content.
- Scalability    
Search millions of vectors, making it suitable for large content repositories.
- Easily manage semantic search capabilities    
Create, edit, delete, and run administrative tasks easily with vector stores.

You must be a database user to interact with vector store. There are two vector store roles, the vector store admin role creates and modifies vector stores objects and the vector store user role who enables the viewing of the vector store objects.
