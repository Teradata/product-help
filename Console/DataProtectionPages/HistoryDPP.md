# History in Data Protection Pages
Review previous backup jobs that have run successfully or failed.

Use the list at the top to select a different backup job and review its history.

Select 
![../Images/more_vert_kebob-15px.svg](../Images/more_vert_kebob-15px.svg) > **View** details to display detailed information about a job, including execution time, errors, warnings, and skipped objects. Skipped objects can be excluded from future runs of the job.

Select 
![../Images/more_vert_kebob-15px.svg](../Images/more_vert_kebob-15px.svg) > Mark protected to protect a backup job. Protected jobs are not deleted.

At least one backup must remain unprotected for subsequent runs. If you keep only two backups and one is protected, you must designate a new protected backup. For example, if you run a backup on the last day of the month, you can choose to protect that copy, then replace the daily backup whenever it runs.

The **Execution Details** lists the errors and skipped objects.
