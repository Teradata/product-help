# Run Data Lake Analytics Using NOS

Use Editor with NOS to run SQL commands that join external data with data stored in cloud data lakes.

We recommend that you start out by exploring the capabilities with a demo use case that is specific to data lake analytics. After the demo, you'll be prepared to use SQL commands in Editor to join external data with data stored in cloud data lakes using NOS.

* Start the Editor guided tour.

**Tip**: If you use NOS while running demo use cases, you don't need to configure the policy because you are accessing a Teradata-managed Amazon S3 bucket.
