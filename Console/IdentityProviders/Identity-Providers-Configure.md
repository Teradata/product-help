# Add Identity Provider

Add a SAML 2.0- or OIDC-compliant identity provider for SSO with the following considerations:

- **Domain**: Domain of the email client
- **SSO Protocol**: OpenID Connect or SAML 2.0
- **Claims**: Email attributes to establish user mapping
 
After you configure the identity provider, you must log out of Console then log back in using your corporate credentials.
