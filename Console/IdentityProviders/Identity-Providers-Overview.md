# Identity Provider

You can authenticate Vantage Console users using Federated Authentication through a SAML- or OIDC-compliant Identity Provider (IDP). Once configured, users will be able to securely initiate sessions in Vantage without the need to log into Vantage Console directly. 

Work with your system security or cloud administrator to set up an IDP in Vantage Console and test the SSO.
