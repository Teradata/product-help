# Create a Sandbox
Create a new sandbox with a selected **Parent Site**. By default, the nodes and cores are fixed and you cannot modify them.

The default status for a sandbox during creation is **Pending**. Upon successful creation or failure, the status changes to **Success** or **Failure** respectively and you get a notification accordingly.

You have to access the sandbox using the **Editor**.
