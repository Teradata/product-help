# Overview of Sandbox
Sandboxes are dedicated child sites with additional permissions completely isolated from production.
The sandboxes provisioned are always empty sandbox sites with no data. However you can  configure sandbox site with Querygrid and query data from parent site.
You can use this data to further investigate the transactions and perform analytics.
