# Overview of Sandbox
Sandboxes are dedicated child sites with additional permissions completely isolated from production.
By default, the provisioned sandboxes does not have any data. However, your sandbox sites are configured with their own Querygrid instances and you can query data from the parent site. 
You can use this data to further investigate the transactions and perform analytics.
