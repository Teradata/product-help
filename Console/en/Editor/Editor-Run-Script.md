Select ![../Images/editor-add-sql-script.jpg](../Images/editor-add-sql-script.jpg) to add a **New script** tab to the **Editor** pane. Enter the SQL statement or script, then select **Run**. You can drag a table name from the list of tables to use in a SQL statement.

To open an existing script, select ![../Images/editor-sql-scripts-folder.jpg](../Images/editor-sql-scripts-folder.jpg) and then select the required script to open in the **Editor**.

**Note:** Selecting a single statement in a script and selecting **Run** runs only that statement.

The results appear in the **Results** pane. When you run a script, the **Editor** returns a **Results** tab for each statement. The **Output** tab shows the number of rows returned for the SQL statements.

To save a script, select ![../Images/MoreOptions.png](../Images/MoreOptions.png), and then select **Save as**. You can also rename an existing script using the **Rename** option.

You can sort and filter results, and download them in JSON or CSV format and copy them to the clipboard.

**Note:** Scripts are stored in your browser history. Scripts do not appear when using another browser or if you clear your browser history. Script tabs will maintain a session for as long as configured (default 10 minutes, max 60).
