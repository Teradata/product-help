Select ![../Images/editor-add-sql-script.jpg](../Images/editor-add-sql-script.jpg) to add a **New script** tab to **Editor**. Enter the SQL statement or script and select **Run**. You can drag a table from the list of tables in the object browser to use in the SQL statement.

To open an existing script, select ![../Images/editor-sql-scripts-folder.jpg](../Images/editor-sql-scripts-folder.jpg) and then select the required script to open in **Editor**.

**Note:** Selecting a single statement, or set of statements, in a script and selecting **Run** runs only the selected statements.

The result set appears in a new **Results** tab each time you run a script. If multiple result sets are returned from running a script, they are returned as separate sub-tabs under the **Results** tab. The run status and other details of each SQL statement are logged in the **History** view. 

To save a script, select ![../Images/MoreOptions.png](../Images/MoreOptions.png), and then select **Save as**. You can also rename an existing script using the **Rename** option.

You can sort and filter the results and export them in an Excel, JSON, or CSV format and copy them to the clipboard.

**Note:** Script tabs maintain a session with the database based on the configuration of sessions (default 15 minutes, maximum 60 minutes).
