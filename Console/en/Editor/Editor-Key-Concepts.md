Use Editor to do the following:

-   Create, edit, run, and save SQL commands and scripts.

-   Browse database objects.

-   Export results in Excel, CSV, or JSON format up to 10,000 table rows.

-   Select **Add to starred** to include a database or user in the list of starred objects.

-   Copy results to the clipboard.

-   Review the status and details of previously run queries.


A query session is tied to the tab that is open, so volatile tables will be maintained as long as the session is configured. 

**Note:** Editor scripts, results, and history are saved to your browser. If you clear the browser history or use another browser, you will not be viewable. Scripts, results, and history can all be saved or exported from the Editor.
