Use Editor to do the following:

-   Create, edit, run, and save SQL commands and scripts for your databases.

-   Open and upload scripts from other sources.

-   Browse object stores.

-   Run SQL commands leveraging NOS to load CSV, JSON, and Parquet data from an external object store into a local table.

-   Download results in CSV or JSON format, up to 10,000 table rows.

-   Copy results to the clipboard.


There are implicit and explicit queries. Implicit queries run in the background. Explicit queries run in the foreground. A query session is tied to the tab that is open, so volatile tables will be maintained as long as the session is configured for.

**Note:** Editor scripts and queries are saved to your browser. If you clear the browser history or use another browser, you will not see your scripts.
