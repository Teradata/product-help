**Backup:** There can only be one protected backup. If there's an existing protected backup, you must confirm your choice to designate a new protected backup.
**Snapshot:** There can be multiple protected snapshots.

Select 
![../Images/more_vert_kebob-15px.svg](../Images/more_vert_kebob-15px.svg) > **Mark protected** to protect a backup job. Protected jobs are not deleted.

At least one backup must remain unprotected for subsequent runs. If you keep only two backups and one is protected, you must designate a new protected backup. For example, if you run a backup on the last day of the month, you can choose to protect that copy, then replace the daily backup whenever it runs.
