Configure the backup jobs with various settings.

**Note:** Retaining more backups may result in additional usage charges. If you reduce the number of retained backups, the next complete backup process deletes those excess backups. Deleted backups cannot be recovered.

Choose a job priority value between the highest priority of 1 and the lowest of 5. Here's how it works:

- By default, every job is assigned a priority of 5.
- If two jobs with different priorities are scheduled to run at the same time, the job with the higher priority runs; the lower-priority job does not.
- If two jobs with the same priority are scheduled to run at the same time, they both run.
