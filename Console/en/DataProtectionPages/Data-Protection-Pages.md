You can also perform cross-site restore of snapshots to perform disaster recovery.

To perform recovery, on the site's Data Protection tab, select the retained snapshot you wish to use, and enable the failover.

For Self-service disaster recovery, from Retained Copies, select the snapshot and click Restore.
