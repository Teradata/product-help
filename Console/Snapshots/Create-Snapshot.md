### Snapshots

Get fast and full-system backups for data protection and recovery. Restore data into target public cloud Teradata systems with minimal downtime. Snapshots cannot perform object-level backups.

Because a snapshot is a virtual copy of data, it is not complete until it has been replicated to another storage system. For example, you might use a snapshot to replicate a full system copy and bring up a second system in another region or zone.

Snapshot recovery varies depending on your installation. Some installations have user-restore functionality, while others automatically open an incident.

Select **Create Snapshot** to get started.
