### Retained Copies

Retained snapshot copies result in recurring storage costs. 

Review existing snapshots that you can rename, restore, or delete. 

Select 
![Kebob](more_vert_kebob-15px.svg), then one of the following: 

- **Rename** to change the snapshot name.
- **Restore** to restore the snapshot to the system, overriding any existing content. Some installations step you through the restore process; others open an incident for Teradata to do the restore.
- **Delete** to remove the snapshot permanently.
