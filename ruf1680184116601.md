A realm is a way to group users for authentication purposes. Typically, you have multiple realms. A realm might represent a department, such as Finance, Marketing, or Data Services.

A realm consists of one or more VantageCloud Lake [Environments](sbt1640280496980.md). An environment can be in only one realm.

For the first identity provider you configure, Vantage creates a realm automatically. That is your default realm. You associate it with one or more environments. You can create additional realms and associate each one with one or more environments.

Go to **Organization**, then **Access Management**, then **Realms**.

Use restricted groups from your identity provider to limit access to the realm.

**Example:** You have two groups in your identity provider: Operations and Research. If you add Research as a restricted group, only users in the Research group can access the environments in the realm. You could create another realm for Operations.
