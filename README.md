h1. About this repository

h2. Codebase
The Vantage, VantageCloudLakeUseCases, and _  folders are the core of the In Product Help in Teradata's Vantage Cloud Lake UI.
The contents of the Vantage folder is json, markdown, and image files transformed from LwDITA topics and ditamaps. The Vantage folder also has localized versions of the English source in es-es, zh_cn, fr_fr, de_de, ja-jp. 
Several folders such as AnalyticFunctions are inactive for years, and can be archived or removed.

h2. Branches, PRs, Tags
The codebase does not currently use release labels or tags. 
The tree uses the master branch, and content-based updates replace what was last committed and pushed. 
Otherwise, no branching is currently used specifically  or only for the help content in this repo. 
Proposed code changes in configurations, such as to the workflow automation, use PRs. 

h2. Looking Ahead
Future UX integrations of the help expeience may include or implement [docs observability](https://passo.uno/docs-observability-do11y/). 
Observable docs has content that can be instrumented with session tracking, analytics, deep linking, and other means to measure how truly effective content meshes with positive user outcomes.
